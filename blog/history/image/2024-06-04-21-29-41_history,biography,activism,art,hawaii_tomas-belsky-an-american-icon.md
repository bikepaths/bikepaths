Tomas Belsky was born on July 4, 1938, in New Brunswick, New Jersey. His parents were immigrants from Russia and Poland who brought rich cultural traditions to their American home. These influences shaped his early years and sparked his interest in creative expression. He studied history, painting, and Spanish in college, building a foundation that would support a life devoted to art and teaching.

His artistic vision took a major turn during his years in Brazil. From 1965 to 1968, Belsky served in the U.S. Peace Corps, working in the favelas of Brazilian cities. There he encountered vibrant street art and grassroots creative traditions that left a deep mark on his work. The experience taught him that art could serve as a tool for change, reaching people who had little access to galleries or museums.

Block printmaking became his signature medium. He favoured this technique for its bold lines and direct expression. The process allowed him to create works that felt raw and alive. Each print reflected his connection to nature and his belief that beauty should be shared widely. He silk-screened every piece by hand, signed it, and marked it with his pinky print. This personal touch made each work unique while keeping prices within reach of ordinary buyers.

Beyond making art, Belsky spent decades teaching. He worked with young people in public schools, jails, and halfway houses across Hawaii. His approach used creative projects to help troubled youth find direction and unlock hidden talents. He believed that making art could transform lives, offering a path away from destructive patterns toward something constructive and meaningful.

Activism ran through his entire adult life. He joined protests against nuclear weapons, colonialism, and military expansion. In Hawaii, he became a vocal defender of sacred lands and native rights. In 2019, at the age of 81, he was among the elders arrested for blocking construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on Mauna Kea. The mountain holds deep spiritual significance for Native Hawaiians, and Belsky stood with those who sought to protect it.

His partner in life and activism was Moanikeala Akaka, a Hawaiian advocate who shared his commitment to social causes. Together they worked on political campaigns and cultural projects. They co-authored a personal account about Uncle Luther, a legendary figure in Hawaiian history. Her death in 2017 marked a painful loss that closed an important chapter of his journey.

Tragedy struck again in 2019 when fire destroyed his home and studio in Hilo. The blaze consumed decades of artwork and personal belongings. Yet Belsky refused to stop. He continued creating prints and selling them at the Hilo Farmers Market, staying connected to the community that had embraced him.

His legacy endures through his art and the lives he touched. Each print carries the spirit of Aloha Aina, the love of the land that guided his work. His story shows how one person can bridge cultures, defend sacred places, and use simple tools to create lasting beauty.
