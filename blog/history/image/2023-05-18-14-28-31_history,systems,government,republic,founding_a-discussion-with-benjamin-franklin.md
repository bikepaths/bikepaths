Benjamin Franklin died in 1790. He knew nothing of fiat currency, central banking, global military alliances, or digital surveillance. Any conversation between Franklin and a modern president would begin with confusion, require extensive explanation of current conditions, and feature Franklin asking questions rather than delivering pre-formed policy positions. The following imagines such a conversation realistically.

The president begins with background. "Mr. Franklin, the federal government now spends nearly six trillion dollars annually. Much of this goes to entitlement programs providing retirement income and medical care to elderly citizens. The government borrows heavily to cover these costs. I wonder if this validates your warning about citizens voting themselves money from the treasury."

Franklin pauses. "Six trillion? Explain the scale. How many citizens exist?"

"About three hundred thirty million."

"Three hundred..." Franklin stops. "The entire population of the colonies in my time numbered perhaps three million. You govern a hundred times that number?"

"Yes. And the landmass extends across the continent, plus territories overseas."

Franklin considers this. "The money you spend, six trillion, what does this represent in terms citizens understand? How many days of labor?"

"The median wage is about sixty thousand annually. So six trillion represents the labor of one hundred million citizens working full years."

"One third of your population working solely to fund government operations?"

"Essentially, though we measure it differently through taxation and borrowing."

Franklin shifts. "You mentioned retirement income provided by government. Explain this system."

The president describes Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Franklin listens without interruption, then speaks. "In my time, families cared for elderly parents. Churches and local communities provided charity for those without family. You have federalized these functions?"

"Yes. Family structures changed. Mobility increased. The old local systems could not scale."

"Could not, or did not?"

The president has no ready answer. Franklin continues. "Did communities attempt to maintain these functions as population grew, or did federal assumption of responsibility precede local failure?"

"The sequence varied by region. Some communities maintained support systems longer than others."

"Then the transition to federal provision was choice, not necessity. You chose centralization." Franklin states this as observation, not judgment. "Tell me about the money itself. You mentioned borrowing. What backs your currency?"

"Nothing tangible. It is fiat money, declared legal by government authority."

Franklin absorbs this. "No gold? No silver?"

"Correct. The Federal Reserve creates money by adjusting numbers in electronic accounts."

"Created from nothing?" Franklin's expression shows genuine confusion. "How do citizens trust money that represents no real value?"

"They trust because government declares it legal tender and most transactions use it."

"They trust because they must, not because the money holds intrinsic worth." Franklin thinks. "What happens when this trust fails?"

"Inflation. The currency buys less. We experienced significant inflation recently when the government created large amounts of money during an economic crisis."

"So you debase your own currency through abundance." Franklin shakes his head slightly. "We debated this extensively. Continental dollars became worthless precisely through this mechanism. We thought hard money provisions in the Constitution prevented such abuse."

"The Constitution was amended. The system evolved."

"Evolved or was circumvented?" Franklin asks directly.

The president shifts topics. "We face division between political factions that see fundamental issues differently. Some favor larger government providing more services. Others favor limited government and individual responsibility. This polarization paralyzes governance."

Franklin responds quickly. "This is not division. This is the permanent condition of free people. Did you imagine citizens would ever agree on the role of government? Of course they disagree. The question is whether institutions force resolution through coercion or allow continued disagreement through federalism."

"But we cannot function when Congress cannot pass legislation."

"Cannot pass legislation, or cannot pass legislation all factions accept?" Franklin leans forward. "These are different problems. If you cannot pass any legislation, your institutions have failed. If you cannot pass legislation everyone supports, your institutions are working precisely as designed. Supermajority requirements and divided powers exist to prevent bare majorities from imposing will on large minorities."

The president considers this. "You designed a system that produces gridlock?"

"We designed a system that requires broad consensus for federal action. When consensus exists, action happens swiftly. When consensus lacks, action should not happen at federal level. Let states decide. Let communities decide. This is not malfunction. This is the core mechanism."

"But urgent problems demand solutions. Climate change, healthcare costs, infrastructure decay, these require federal coordination."

"Why?" Franklin asks simply.

"Because they affect all states. Because individual states lack resources or authority to address them alone."

"Did all states agree these problems require federal solutions?"

"No, but..."

"Then your premise fails. You claim urgency demands action, but half your states reject the proposed solutions. This does not indicate urgent consensus. This indicates contested priorities. In such situations, our system properly prevents federal imposition. Let proponents convince opponents. Let states experiment with different approaches. Learn what works. Then, if consensus forms, act federally."

The president presses forward. "We face foreign threats requiring massive military spending. We maintain forces across the world to protect American interests and allies."

"Across the world?" Franklin's tone sharpens. "Explain."

The president describes the global military presence. Franklin interrupts. "Why?"

"To maintain stability. To prevent regional conflicts from escalating."

"Whose stability? Whose conflicts?" Franklin sits back. "We discussed entangling alliances extensively. We concluded they served European monarchies, not republics. Alliances force nations into wars that serve others' interests. Why have you chosen this path?"

"The world changed. Isolationism failed in the twentieth century."

"Isolationism and entangling alliances are not the only options. Trade freely. Maintain strong defense of your actual territory. Assist allies when interests genuinely align. But permanent military commitments across the globe? This seems designed to create the very conflicts you claim to prevent."

The conversation continues. Franklin asks about education, inquiring why federal government involves itself in what he understood as entirely local concern. He asks about currency creation again, struggling to understand how money created from nothing retains value. He asks whether states still possess independent authority or whether federal power has consumed formerly state functions.

The pattern emerges. Franklin does not speak as policy expert on modern issues. He speaks as someone grounded in specific principles who sees modern applications of familiar patterns. Fiat money resembles continental currency abuse. Federal provision of retirement income resembles monarchical patronage creating dependence. Global military presence resembles the imperial overreach that bankrupted European powers.

He offers no modern policy prescriptions because he lacks context for modern conditions. He instead identifies principles from experience and asks whether current policies align with or violate those principles. When told polarization threatens the republic, he questions whether the republic was designed for universal agreement. When told urgent problems demand federal action despite state disagreement, he questions whether such problems are truly urgent or merely contested.

The president concludes, "Your principles may have worked in a simpler time, but modern complexity demands modern solutions."

Franklin responds carefully. "Principles either reflect permanent aspects of human nature and political organization or they reflect temporary circumstances. We believed we had identified permanent principles: that power concentrates, that monopoly breeds corruption, that human judgment fails at scale, that local knowledge exceeds distant expertise, that generations should not bind their descendants to unpayable debts. If these principles were temporary, suited only to small agrarian societies, then they were not principles at all, merely expedient guidelines. But if they were principles, if they reflect how humans actually organize and govern, then complexity does not invalidate them. Complexity makes them more essential, because the consequences of violating them scale with the size of violation."

The conversation ends without resolution. Franklin has no blueprint for modern governance. He has observations based on experience with human nature and republican government. Whether those observations apply depends on whether the principles underlying them remain valid. That question cannot be settled in a single discussion.

The exercise reveals limits of historical analogy. Franklin cannot comment meaningfully on technologies and systems he never encountered. He can only apply the reasoning he developed in his context to descriptions of modern conditions. Whether that reasoning transfers or requires revision remains contested. Those who believe human nature and governmental organization follow permanent patterns find his observations relevant. Those who believe modernity requires abandoning eighteenth-century frameworks find them quaint. The discussion illuminates this divide without resolving it.
