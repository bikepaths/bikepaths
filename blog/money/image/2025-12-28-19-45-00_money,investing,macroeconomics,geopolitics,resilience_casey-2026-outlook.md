Stability is a mirage during the final phase of institutional decay. Doug Casey, the author who witnessed the birth of the global contrarian movement, identifies 2026 as a key intersection in the Fourth Turning. The American experiment face a state of internal friction that mirrors the deep fractures of historical civil strife. Observers note that when groups lose the ability to talk, the resolution typically arrives through force. This pattern suggests that modern domestic tensions are not just political disagreements but signals of a closing cycle.

The global landscape reflects a similar process of institutional liquidation. European leaders stay trapped in a state of stagnant control while driving the continent toward rearmament and regional conflict. The European Union serves as a primary example of how bureaucratic momentum persists even after the economic base has eroded. The euro survives as a currency with no anchor, awaiting a final break in the union. Geopolitical flashpoints are shifting toward artificial areas in Africa. Here, arbitrary borders and resource rulers create conditions for a massive powderkeg.

Monetary chaos becomes the result when central planning replaces market discovery. The growth of the dollar supply ensures that the currency continues a path toward its intrinsic value. Mercantilist plans and exchange controls represent attempts to keep power rather than restore stability. This environment requires a total rejection of paper distractions. Trust in institutional claims must be replaced with the direct witness of tangible value. Survival in a decaying system depends on the ability to see patterns before they manifest as total failure.

Resilience emerges from the collection of durable assets that exist outside the control of failing systems. Precious metals stay positioned as the primary shield against the death of fiat currency. Gold and silver remain the only forms of money that do not rely on the integrity of a bankrupt partner. The mining sector offers a rare chance for those who understand the math of production costs versus market neglect. Broad use of energy and agriculture provides the necessary shield against the loss of purchasing power.

Reclaiming sovereignty requires the recognition that institutional safety is an illusion. The choices made today determine the level of freedom available when the current frameworks reach their final conclusion. Success is measured by the shift from passive observation to active preparation. This involves moving capital away from failing centers of power and securing a future founded on tangible reality. The Fourth Turning demands a new social mythology. This framework centers on self-reliance and the preservation of values that outlast the collapse of temporary states.
