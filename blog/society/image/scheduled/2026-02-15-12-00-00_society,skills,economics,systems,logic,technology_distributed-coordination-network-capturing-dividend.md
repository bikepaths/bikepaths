This is a foundational exploration within the Moral Physics project. We examine the intersection of distributed economics, coordination efficiency, and the community's transition to a state of logistical sovereignty.

**The Coordination Tax**

Every community currently pays a massive, invisible penalty for its dependence on centralized systems. This represents the *Coordination Tax*. It identifies the capital, time, and attention consumed by bureaucratic middlemen, partisan fundraisers, and inefficient institutional gatekeepers (Tainter, 1988). In the legacy model, we have accepted this friction as the cost of living in a modern society. However, when we analyze these systems through the lens of cybernetics, we observe that most of this tax represents purely mechanical waste. It results from forcing high-variety social energy through low-bandwidth political channels. To restore our communal agency, we must first identify where our energy drains and prepare to reclaim it.

**Capturing the Dividend**

When we decouple our local coordination from failing centralized machines, we generate a significant *Logistical Dividend*. This represents the surplus energy recovered by eliminating the middlemen. Capturing this dividend requires the establishment of a *Distributed Coordination Network* (DCN). We recirculate our resources within our own nodes (Beer, 1974). We create a closed-loop economy where the efficiency gains of automated logistics return directly to the participants. This recovered capital funds the vital functions of the community, from mutual aid and security to infrastructure and education, ensuring that our survival becomes independent of the subsidies of a distant state.

**Hardware Conditioning**

The stability of the DCN depends on the integrity of its physical and digital architecture. We must apply the logic of the Spending Clause at the local level to ensure our reclaimed resources receive protection. This means that we condition the use of community capital on the adoption of high-integrity hardware and software (Nakamoto, 2008). We invest exclusively in the Integrity Stack: immutable ledgers, open-source coordination tools, and secure communication nodes. By conditioning our environment in this way, we enforce a standard of structural truth that prevents the re-emergence of the bureaucratic decay we have just escaped.

**The Utility State**

The end state of this transition involves the emergence of governance as a logistical utility. In this model, the "state" functions as the frictionless infrastructure that allows individuals and groups to coordinate their lives with maximum precision and minimum waste. We achieve this by moving the Administration of Things into the background of our social logic. When our ledgers become transparent and our coordination becomes automated, the energy currently wasted on political maneuvering gets liberated for the creative development of the community. We build a world where the primary function of governance involves staying out of the way of human potential while providing the reliable ground truth upon which that potential builds.

**The Practice of Reclamation**

We recognize that capturing the *Logistical Dividend* requires continuous monitoring of resource flows. We track where our capital exits the local network and enters the centralized void. We identify the specific middlemen extracting value from our coordination. We calculate the metabolic cost of maintaining our dependence on legacy systems. This practice enables us to make informed decisions about where to redirect our energy toward high-integrity local infrastructure.

**Glossary**

- **Coordination Tax**: The energy, time, and capital lost to the friction of centralized bureaucratic and partisan systems.
- **Logistical Dividend**: The surplus resources recovered by optimizing the coordination of a network and eliminating middlemen.
- **Distributed Coordination Network**: A localized, high-integrity framework for managing community resources and mutual aid.
- **Utility State**: A governance model where the administration of logistics becomes automated and transparent, functioning as a silent utility.
- **Spending Clause**: The principle of conditioning resource allocation on adherence to structural integrity standards.
- **Moral Physics**: The mechanical reality where economic and coordination choices produce predictable consequences in a system.

**Assumptions and Assertions**

- [Assumption] Centralized systems inevitably extract a coordination tax to maintain their own institutional hierarchy (Tainter, 1988).
- [Assertion] Reclaimed coordination energy serves as a multiplier for local economic and social stability (DiBella, 2026).
- [Assertion] Conditioning resource allocation on structural integrity prevents the return of systemic entropy (Nakamoto, 2008).
- [Assertion] The transition to a logistical utility model represents the final phase of post-partisan stability (Beer, 1974).
