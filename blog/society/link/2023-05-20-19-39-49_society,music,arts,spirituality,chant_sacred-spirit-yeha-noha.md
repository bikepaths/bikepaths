***Yeha-Noha*** is a song by the musical project Sacred Spirit, which was created by German musician Claus Zundel, also known as The Fearsome Brave. The song was released in 1994 as part of the album *Sacred Spirit: Chants and Dances of the Native Americans.*

It is a Native American chant-inspired song that incorporates traditional Native American vocals, chants, and instrumentation with contemporary elements. The title is a phrase from the Navajo language, which translates to "*wishes of happiness and prosperity*" or "*hope for happiness and harmony.*"

The song became popular worldwide for its fusion of Native American spirituality and modern musical production. It carries a message of unity, respect for nature, and the importance of finding harmony within oneself and with the world.

"Yeha-Noha" has been praised for its beautiful melodies, evocative atmosphere, and respectful representation of Native American culture. It has had a significant impact in bringing attention to Native American traditions and promoting cross-cultural understanding.

The lyrics are repetitive as the song relies more on the traditional Native American chants, vocals, and instrumentals to create its atmospheric and spiritual effect.
