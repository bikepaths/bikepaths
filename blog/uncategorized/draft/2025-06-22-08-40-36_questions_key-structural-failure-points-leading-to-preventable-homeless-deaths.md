Most die not from lack of resources, but from compounded barriers—mental illness, addiction, isolation, bureaucracy, trauma, and hostile environments—where survival knowledge, mobility, or access breaks down under stress, illness, or social abandonment. 

Key structural failure points leading to preventable homeless deaths:

1. **Mental illness and cognitive decline**

   * Undiagnosed or untreated conditions impair judgment, risk assessment, and ability to seek shelter or aid.
   * Disorientation or paranoia can lead to refusal of help even in life-threatening cold.

2. **Addiction and substance dependency**

   * Intoxication lowers core body temperature, dulls awareness, and disrupts survival instincts.
   * Withdrawal and drug-seeking displace basic needs like shelter or clothing.

3. **Medical vulnerability**

   * Chronic illnesses (diabetes, COPD, infections) worsen in cold/damp; mobility, circulation, or immunity are compromised.
   * Many die quietly from untreated conditions mistaken for sleep.

4. **Isolation and estrangement**

   * Lack of social ties reduces chances of being checked on, informed, or helped during crises.
   * Many freeze or suffer unnoticed in low-traffic areas.

5. **Systemic barriers and bureaucracy**

   * Shelter access may require ID, sobriety, gender segregation, or scheduled intake.
   * Complex intake processes exclude those in crisis, under stress, or fearful of authority.

6. **Urban hostility and displacement**

   * Police sweeps, “hostile architecture,” and removal of encampments disrupt stability.
   * People forced to keep moving lose routines, community, and safe fallback spots.

7. **Weather unpredictability and fatigue**

   * Sudden temperature drops, exhaustion from walking, soaked clothing—any one night of exposure can be fatal.
   * After days without rest or food, even strong individuals collapse.
