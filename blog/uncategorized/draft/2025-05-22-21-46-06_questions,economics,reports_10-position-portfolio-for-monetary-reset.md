**Structure Strategy**
40% Precious Metals Exposure (Gold/Silver: producers, royalty, physical)
20% Commodity & Alternative Hard Assets (Uranium, Agriculture)
20% Speculative & Growth (Junior miners, emerging themes)
20% Defensive Cash Flow (Industrial + Dividend Consumer)

**Execution Timing**
Buy into minor pullbacks. Set staggered limit orders if volatility spikes. Maintain 10–15% reserve cash for opportunistic buying.

**5 Tangential Issues for Exploration**
Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as new monetary layer
Foreign central banks repatriating gold
BIS gold leasing and unallocated account exposures
Commodity-backed bond issuance in BRICS+ nations
Digital gold platforms and tokenized reserves
