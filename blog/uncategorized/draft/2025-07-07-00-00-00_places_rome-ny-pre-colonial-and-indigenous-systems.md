####"The carry was the bridge between these two worlds."

----------
Before the first maps were ever drawn by European hands, the land around Rome was already a place of great importance, a central hub in a world defined by natural pathways. The people of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, also known as the Iroquois, understood this land with a wisdom born from generations of experience. They saw that the geography of this specific place offered a unique gift: a nearly unbroken water route that stretched across the continent. The key to this route was the Oneida Carrying Place. Its geographic logic was simple and powerful. It was the shortest and easiest path between the two great water systems that defined their world. To the east, the Mohawk River flowed toward the rising sun, offering a path to the ocean. To the west, Wood Creek flowed toward the setting sun, opening the way to the Great Lakes. The carry was the bridge between these two worlds.

The Oneida Nation, the People of the Standing Stone, were the keepers of this vital corridor. Their villages and settlements were established throughout the region, positioned to take advantage of the rich resources of the forests and rivers. Their lives were organized around the rhythm of the seasons. In the spring, they would fish in the teeming waters of the creeks and rivers. In the summer, they would tend to large fields of corn, beans, and squash, the Three Sisters that sustained their communities. In the fall, they would hunt and prepare for the long winters. Their movement was a carefully planned cycle of travel and settlement that followed the patterns of the natural world. The Oneida Carrying Place was central to this cycle, serving as a highway for trade, a meeting place for councils, and a strategic route for defense.

The Haudenosaunee Confederacy was a sophisticated political and social alliance of six distinct nations, and the Oneida were one of its founding members. This confederacy was bound together by a common law and a shared vision of peace and strength. Diplomacy was a cornerstone of their society. The natural corridors of the region, like the Mohawk River valley, were the arteries of this diplomacy. Leaders and messengers would travel these routes, carrying wampum belts that served as official records and symbols of their agreements. The Oneida Carrying Place was a critical junction in this diplomatic network. It was a place of formal ceremony and council, where leaders from different nations would meet to negotiate treaties, resolve disputes, and strengthen their alliances. The free flow of people and ideas across the carry was essential to the health and unity of the Confederacy.

Today, the legacy of the Oneida people and their deep connection to this land is actively preserved. The modern Oneida Indian Nation has made great efforts to ensure that this history is remembered and honored. At the Fort Stanwix National Monument, which sits directly on the site of the ancient carry, interpretive programs now include the Oneida perspective. These programs explain the true significance of the site, emphasizing its ancient importance to the Haudenosaunee, a history that precedes its role as a military fort. The Nation has also worked to mark the path of the carry and to create educational materials that tell its story. Through these efforts, the enduring presence of the Oneida people is made visible, reminding all who visit that the history of Rome began with a people who understood the power and spirit of the land.
