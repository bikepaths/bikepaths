A better solution involves understanding and respecting the diverse needs of individuals experiencing homelessness. This can be achieved through:

* **Asking (when safe and appropriate):** Inquiring about specific needs or preferences can lead to more relevant and appreciated contributions.
* **Offering choices:** Providing options, if feasible, allows individuals to select what they truly need or want.
* **Supporting established organizations:** Non-profits working directly with the homeless often have a better understanding of the community's needs and efficient distribution systems. Monetary donations can provide flexibility for these organizations to address the most pressing issues.
* **Donating specific, needed items:** Focusing on consistently required items like socks, hygiene products, or unopened non-perishable food (while being mindful of storage limitations for individuals) can be more helpful.
* **Advocating for systemic change:** Addressing the root causes of homelessness through policy changes and increased support for social services can create more sustainable solutions.

In essence, the solution moves beyond simply giving and focuses on **thoughtful engagement, respect for autonomy, and supporting effective systems** that address the complex realities of homelessness.
