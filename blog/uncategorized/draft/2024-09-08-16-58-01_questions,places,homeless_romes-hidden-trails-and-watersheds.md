Growing up in Rome, many of us have cherished memories of exploring the trails and parks around the Mohawk River. Those old dirt paths, winding through the trees and along the riverbanks, were our playgrounds and our escapes into nature. Lately, however, these beloved trails are facing some serious challenges that we need to address together.

It’s not the new paved trails causing issues; it’s the old, undeveloped dirt paths where we spent our childhood. These areas, still as they were back then, have become spots where individuals without homes find temporary shelter. This has led to problems with safety, sanitation, and the overall health of our environment. Trash and waste in these areas not only mar the natural beauty but also threaten the health of our local ecosystem.

Our community has always been deeply connected to our watersheds and riparian areas. The Mohawk River and its surrounding streams are crucial for local wildlife and plant life. When waste accumulates in these areas, it endangers our water quality and disrupts the habitats that sustain our environment. The runoff from these trails ends up in the river, carrying harmful substances and pollutants.

This situation is more than just an environmental issue; it’s a reflection of our community values. Our trails and rivers are where we find peace, reconnect with nature, and share these experiences with our children and grandchildren. We must act now to preserve our natural areas for future generations.

If you can, take a walk down some of our old trails. You might park behind the fire station on River Street, at Pinti Field, or Hazelton Park. Bring a bike or simply walk and look around. If you spot areas in need of cleaning or see trash that’s been left behind, take note. If a particular spot needs more attention than you can give, mention it to local leaders who can help address the issue.

Addressing these problems can be challenging, especially when it involves homelessness and its associated difficulties. But with compassion and collective effort, we can improve our trails and ensure they remain beautiful and safe for everyone, especially our children. This is not about placing blame but about taking care of Rome, just as we have always done.

Access to basic hygiene facilities is crucial. Currently, the restrooms at Pinti Field and Hazelton Park are locked outside of events due to vandalism. Installing a handicap-accessible portable toilet with hand sanitizer, monitored by a camera, could provide a reliable solution. This way, we can support those in need while maintaining public cleanliness and safety.

The presence of trash from homeless individuals in undeveloped areas is a significant concern. Regular clean-ups by volunteers, combined with adequate sanitation facilities, are essential to protecting our natural areas. Additionally, addressing mental health issues with support services can help manage and mitigate some of the root causes of homelessness.

Let’s come together to preserve the Rome we love. Our rivers, trails, and community reflect who we are and deserve our respect and care. By taking action and working together, we can ensure that these treasures remain a part of our lives for generations to come.
