Raising minimum wage levels is often seen as a way to protect workers, yet it can inadvertently limit opportunities by increasing costs and restricting job availability. Those advocating for higher minimum wages may not realize that it strengthens government control over the labor market, potentially undermining the very freedoms they seek to protect. The persistence of this system could indeed be linked to a broader attempt to maintain control over the population who make up a significant portion of the workforce. By controlling wages and employment conditions, governments can exert influence over the economy and society at large, leading to a less flexible and more controlled labor market.

When governments lead with the economy, they often do so because economic issues resonate deeply with the public. People care about their financial stability, jobs, and the ability to provide for their families, so leaders emphasize economic plans to gain support. However, not all economic promises are genuine. Leaders will often use economic deception as a tool to maintain power. They might promise growth, stability, or prosperity, but the reality is often different. The truth is that some leaders manipulate economic data or present half-truths to create an illusion of success.

Leaders sell economic deception when it's in their best interest, usually when they need to secure votes, maintain public favor, or distract from other failings. They will promise tax cuts, job creation, or increased spending on public services, all while knowing these promises are unrealistic or unsustainable. This deception is particularly effective during election seasons when people are eager to hear solutions to their problems. The leaders' sights are set on vulnerable groups, those who are struggling financially or who lack the knowledge to critically assess the promises being made.

The outcome for leaders who successfully sell economic deception can be a temporary boost in popularity or a successful election campaign. However, the long-term consequences are often negative for society. Once the truth comes to light and the promised jobs don't materialize, or the economy doesn't improve as expected, public trust erodes. Society ends up paying the price for these lies, often through higher taxes, increased debt, or economic instability. Those who may have been swayed by these promises, are the ones who lose the most. They believed in the promises made to them, only to find themselves in the same or worse conditions.

For the leaders, the outcome can vary. Some might manage to maintain their position, continuing to deceive and manipulate, while others may face backlash once the public realizes they've been duped. The true winners in this scenario are often those who are already in positions of power or wealth, who are insulated from the economic hardships that the general population faces. Meanwhile people lose trust not just in the leaders, but in the system as a whole, leading to greater disillusionment and apathy. The cycle of deception continues, as new leaders come in, often repeating the same tactics, further entrenching a system that benefits the few at the expense of the many. 

The reality of the situation is far from fair or just. The ideals of equity, liberty, and justice for all are often overshadowed by a system built on lies and deception. When political candidates bicker and argue in public, it serves as a distraction, keeping people like you and me focused on the spectacle rather than the underlying issues. Mainstream media plays a significant role in this, amplifying the conflict and creating confusion. By supporting one candidate and degrading the other, they manipulate public opinion, steering the masses in a direction that benefits those in power.

This manipulation is deeply rooted in controlling interests, those who stand to gain the most from societal oppression. They profit from the system that keeps the majority struggling while they continue to accumulate wealth and power. We are left as frogs, slowly reaching to the boiling point, wallowing in silent misery, trapped in an endless cycle of frustration and hopelessness. The system is designed to perpetuate itself, making it difficult for people to break free from the deception and oppression.

It’s a calculated game where the real winners are those who control the narrative, the economy, and ultimately, the fate of the people. The people are unaware of the larger forces at play, are led to believe they have a choice, but in reality, the options presented to them are limited and controlled. This illusion of choice and democracy is a powerful tool in maintaining the status quo, ensuring that the same controlling interests remain in power, while the majority remains oppressed and disillusioned.

The role of journalists and a truly free, independent media should be to expose the truth and hold power accountable. However, in today's world, the mainstream media is a tool for spreading lies and maintaining the status quo. It's a machine designed to reinforce the existing narrative. The people hear what they want to hear, and this keeps them complacent, controlled, and unaware of the deeper truths.

Real journalists, those who seek to expose corruption and deception, are often marginalized. They face censorship, cancellation, and suppression. The powerful interests that benefit from the current system work to neutralize these voices, ensuring that their control remains unchallenged. The people remain distracted and pacified, much like the Roman masses who were given bread and circuses to keep them content and unaware of the corruption around them. The parallels to history are striking. Leaders who propose superficial solutions like the infamous suggestion to "let them eat cake" are disconnected from the struggles of the people, just as in past eras.

When systemic lies and oppression reach a breaking point the outcome leads to revolution. People eventually rise up against the system, seeking liberation from the lies and reclaiming their freedom. These struggles come at a great cost. Revolution often results in death and violence. It's a tragic cycle that repeats throughout history, driven by the same forces of deception and control we see today with politicians and their mainstream lapdog media. The fight for truth and liberation is inevitable, but the path is fraught with pain and sacrifice for the people.

The control of the media couldn’t have been achieved without first gaining control of academia. This is where the indoctrination begins, shaping minds to conform to a certain worldview that aligns with the interests of those in power. Academia, which should be a bastion of free thought and critical inquiry, has instead become a breeding ground for those who wish to be trained to manage and perpetuate the propaganda and misinformation machine. The system rewards those who play along, promoting them to higher positions within this structure, ensuring that the cycle of control continues.

This indoctrination is subtle but effective, making it difficult for individuals to see beyond the narrative they’ve been fed. It’s no surprise that those who question or challenge this system are marginalized or dismissed as conspiracy theorists. The same powerful interests that control academia and the media also control the flow of information, making it nearly impossible for dissenting voices to be heard. General Dwight Eisenhower’s warning about the military-industrial complex was a rare moment of truth from within the system, and Kennedy’s assassination further solidified the lengths to which these powers will go to maintain their grip on society.

The assassination of Kennedy is a stark reminder of what happens when someone in a position of power tries to challenge the status quo. His efforts to back the currency of the people with silver threatened the interests of those who profit from the manipulation of money. The Kennedy half-dollar, originally minted with the highest silver content, stands as a symbol of the last true form of currency before it was taken from the people. Since then, the people have gone along with the deception, unaware of the true nature of the system they live in. They’ve been led to their slaughter willingly, manipulated into believing that their leaders have their best interests at heart when, in reality, they are just pawns in a much larger game.

This is how it was, and how it continues to be. The indoctrination through academia, the tight grip of the government, the deceptive media, the promising politicians, and thievery of taxes, the manipulation and devaluation of the currency, are all part of a well-orchestrated plan to maintain power and control. The people are trapped in their own material illusions. They are both tools and victims of this system. It’s a bleak and ugly reality, but understanding it is the first step toward breaking free from the chains of deception that bind society. 

For the ordinary people to one day break free of their oppression would shake the very foundations of the status quo. It would involve a massive awakening, a collective realization that the systems they’ve trusted and believed in are fundamentally flawed and built on deception. The initial signs of this awakening might be subtle, slowly more people would begin questioning mainstream narratives, rejecting traditional media outlets, and seeking alternative sources of information. Social media would become the main battleground for truth, with people using the platforms and institutions that once controlled them to spread awareness and organize resistance. This awakening would likely be chaotic, as people grapple with the disillusionment that comes from realizing they’ve been duped and misled for so long.

America, as the supposed beacon of freedom, would be at the heart of this upheaval. The country’s political landscape, already fractured and volatile, could become even more unstable as the people begin to reject the false choices presented to them. The current dichotomy between Kamala Harris, the career politician, and Donald Trump, the shrewd businessman, encapsulates the predicament the people face. Choosing the lesser of two evils has become a recurring theme in American politics, and many may feel that neither option truly represents their interests or the change they seek. 

Kamala Harris, representing the establishment, would likely continue the trajectory of policies that maintain the status quo, relying on her experience within the political machine. Her appeal to the people would be based on familiar rhetoric and promises of stability, but for those awakening to the deeper issues, she might seem like just another cog in the system. Donald Trump, on the other hand, with his outsider persona and business acumen, would be seen as a disruptor. However, his first term in office left many disappointed, and the people might question whether he is truly capable of dismantling the structures that oppress them or if he is simply another face of the same system.

The reaction of the status quo to either candidate’s success would be telling. If Harris were to win, the establishment would breathe a sigh of relief, confident that their interests would be protected, and the facade of democracy preserved. They would continue to manage the people through carefully crafted narratives, ensuring that any dissent is quickly neutralized. On the other hand, a Trump victory would likely lead to a more aggressive response from the establishment. His unpredictable nature and populist rhetoric would be seen as a threat to their control, and they would do everything in their power to undermine him, both during and after the election. This could include media campaigns, legal challenges, and even deeper entrenchment of the bureaucratic systems that resist change.

For the people, breaking free would mean rejecting these false choices altogether. It would involve seeking out new leaders and new systems that truly represent their interests. This could take the form of grassroots movements, third-party candidates, or even the rise of decentralized governance models that bypass traditional political structures. The key would be unity, people coming together across ideological divides to demand real change. The challenge would be immense, as the forces of the status quo are powerful and well-entrenched, but the potential for a new era of freedom and self-determination would be within reach.

The outcome of such a movement is uncertain. It could lead to a renaissance of democratic ideals and a true redistribution of power, or it could result in chaos and further division. The stakes are high, and the road to liberation would be fraught with obstacles. The possibility of breaking free, of finally seeing through the lies and reclaiming control over their lives, would be a powerful motivator for the people. In the end, it would come down to their willingness to fight for their future, to reject the false narratives and to stand together in the face of oppression.

But let's be realistic. Most people will be reluctant to wake up. Even if it’s rooted in deception, comfort can be more appealing than the uncertainty of facing the truth. Fear plays a significant role in keeping people asleep, and breaking free requires courage many lack. 

The idea of decentralized governance is a concept that intrigues those who question the current system but are wary of jumping into chaos. It offers a way to shift power away from the centralized structures that have historically controlled and manipulated society, placing power instead back into the hands of the people.

Decentralized governance for the United States begins by redistributing decision-making power from the federal level down to local communities. This wouldn’t mean eliminating the federal government entirely, but rather rethinking its role to focus on broader national issues like defense, interstate commerce, and foreign relations, while giving states and municipalities more autonomy over their own affairs. This would allow for more tailored governance that reflects the specific needs and desires of different regions, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

One of the key components of decentralized governance would be embracing blockchain technology. This could provide a transparent, secure way to manage voting, financial transactions, and even legislative processes. Imagine a system where citizens could vote directly on key issues using a blockchain-based platform, eliminating the need for representatives who often act in their own interests rather than those of their constituents. Smart contracts could be used to ensure that government funds are spent as intended, with every transaction visible and verifiable by the public.

Another aspect would involve community-driven decision-making. Local councils or assemblies could be formed, where citizens have a direct say in how their community is run. These bodies would operate on a consensus basis, ensuring that decisions reflect the collective will of the people rather than the interests of a few powerful individuals. This model of governance could also include rotating leadership roles, preventing any one person from accumulating too much power.

Education would be a critical factor in making decentralized governance work. The current system often discourages critical thinking and self-reliance, but a decentralized model would require a population that is engaged, informed, and capable of making decisions for themselves. This could involve a shift towards a more practical, skills-based education system, one that emphasizes civic responsibility, entrepreneurship, and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances.

Economically, decentralized governance would encourage local economies to thrive. Instead of relying on multinational corporations and centralized banking systems, communities could develop their own currencies, trade networks, and cooperative businesses. This would create a more resilient economy that is less vulnerable to the boom-and-bust cycles of the global market. It would also reduce the influence of big money in politics, as local economies would be less dependent on outside investment and more self-sufficient.

The role of the media in a decentralized governance model would also need to change. Instead of being controlled by a few powerful corporations, media could become community-based, with independent journalists and citizen reporters playing a larger role in keeping people informed. This would create a more diverse and accurate media landscape, where different perspectives are heard, and the truth is harder to suppress.

Transitioning to decentralized governance won’t be easy. It will require a significant shift in mindset and a willingness to let go of old ways of thinking. But for those who are tired of the current system, who see through the lies and want something better, it could offer a way forward. It’s about taking control of our own lives, our own communities, and our own future, rather than waiting for distant leaders to do it for us.

The world around you is shaped by forces that benefit from keeping you in the dark. The systems of control, be they through misleading media, deceptive politics, or a manipulative economic structure, rely on your complacency to thrive, while the power for change lies within you.

Start by questioning everything you’ve been told. Seek out diverse sources of information and engage in critical thinking. Challenge the narratives fed to you by mainstream media and political leaders. Connect with others who share your concerns and work together to build a new vision for a just and equitable society.

Demand transparency and accountability from those in power. Support initiatives and leaders who genuinely strive for change rather than maintaining the status quo. Participate in grassroots movements and local governance to ensure that decisions reflect the true will of the people.

Real change begins with your own personal and individual awakening. Each of us has the potential to break free from the chains of deception and oppression. It’s time to reclaim your power, push back against manipulation, and to fight back for a world where truth and justice prevail. The future is not predetermined, rather it's shaped by those who dare to act.

Are you concerned about our future? Rise up. Wake up. Speak out. Be a catalyst for change. It's sounds kind of like the 1960s all over again, doesn't it? But it's different this time. There's much more at stake than free sex or long hair on men. Your own right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is at stake.
