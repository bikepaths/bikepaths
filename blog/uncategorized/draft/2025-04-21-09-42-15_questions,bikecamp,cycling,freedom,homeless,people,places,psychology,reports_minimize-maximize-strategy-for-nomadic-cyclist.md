Confirmed operational flexibility.

**Core Mobility and Survival Protocol:**

1. **Digital Access:**  
   - **Essential Devices:** Carry lightweight smartphone and power bank.  
   - **Charging:** Use public libraries, cafes, transportation hubs, and solar charger (optional).  
   - **Connectivity:** Prioritize Wi-Fi access points; mobile SIM with data if affordable.  
   - **Platforms:** Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Email.

2. **Acquisition of Bicycle and Gear:**  
   - **Marketplace First Contact:** Locate via FB Marketplace, set appointments, negotiate.  
   - **Gear Needed:** Tent, sleeping bag, stove (optional), pump, patch kit, bags, lock.  
   - **Weather Protection:** Minimum one-person tent or bivy sack is essential for shelter.  
   - **Purchasing:** Confirm viability before travel. Buy gear after confirming bike and transport ability.

3. **Daily Operation:**  
   - **Water:** Always carry container and refill opportunistically.  
   - **Food:** Use food banks, soup kitchens, discarded goods, foraging, public notices.  
   - **Shelter:** Camp discreetly in low-visibility areas. Use overpasses, woods, or designated unhoused areas.

4. **Communication and Navigation:**  
   - **Primary Tools:** Smartphone for maps, appointments, translations, contacts.  
   - **Battery Protocol:** Preserve charge, prioritize communication and navigation.  
   - **Backup Strategy:** Paper map and physical note of contacts and meeting times.

5. **Housing Acquisition (If Applicable):**  
   - **Contact NGOs, churches, shelters.**  
   - **Use local online groups for temporary stays (couchsurfing, warmshowers).**  
   - **Build relationships via recurring contact and respectful presence.**

6. **Income Limitation Adaptation:**  
   - **Scavenge, trade labor for gear or food, apply for assistance where possible.**  
   - **Minimize gear cost via used markets, donations, and public access.**

**Summary:** Maintain device and charging strategy, secure minimal shelter, buy locally through multiple online platforms, stay connected, remain visible to human networks, ensure daily water, food, and warmth.
