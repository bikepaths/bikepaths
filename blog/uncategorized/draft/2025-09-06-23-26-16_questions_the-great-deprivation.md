Most lost one of their fundamental senses, severed from reality in a quiet instant. Some no longer saw. Others heard nothing. Many lost their sense of direction, taste, or balance. But it wasn’t random. Each affected differently, but with perfect completeness in the deprivation. It struck globally, like a neurological plague, silent and synchronized.

The cause remains unknown—possibly an airborne neurotoxin, an abrupt shift in atmospheric radiation, or a coordinated cosmic event targeting human neurology through unknown channels. Satellites failed to detect it before it happened. Animals were less affected, though disoriented. Machines ran idle, awaiting human touch that no longer came. Cities dimmed by nightfall, power grids untended, networks gone dark.

The aftermath settled quickly and brutally. Planes fell. Cars drifted or slammed into barriers. Trains halted. Within twenty-four hours, an estimated 200 million had died from direct consequences: crashes, fires, falls, and environmental exposure. Another 600 million succumbed in the following days from dehydration, starvation, or being unable to escape dangerous situations. Hospitals became morgues. Elevators became tombs.

Rough estimates place the global death toll in the first month at 4.8 billion. Another billion are in critical danger: isolated, wandering, unable to feed or hydrate themselves. Only about 100 to 200 million retain their senses. Among them, 10 million are estimated to be within stable conditions—access to food, water, shelter, and other survivors. These are the ones with a chance to adapt, gather, and rebuild.

The reason is cruel in its precision. Sensory loss disables the ability to survive independently. Without sight, people stumble or wait in fear. Without hearing, they cannot respond to danger or communicate. Without touch or proprioception, they fall, cannot hold tools or eat. Most couldn’t adapt in time. Those with compromised senses became liabilities to themselves, then to others. The few with full faculties are too sparse to help the rest.

Some clusters formed in areas where survivors happened to be near supplies or infrastructure. A school gym with bottled water. A warehouse near a solar generator. An underground shelter. These loci become sanctuaries, forming the nuclei of emerging communities. Each is desperate to remain hidden or protected. Those left wandering often panic when approached, their sensory deprivation making them lash out or retreat in terror.

Agricultural systems fail first. Harvests rot, machines rust. Livestock go untended. Supermarkets become husks. Soon after, water systems falter—no staff to maintain pumps, treat reservoirs, or monitor contamination. Cities grow fetid. Disease looms. Survivors drink cautiously from rain catchments, boil water if they can make fire. Basic tasks require immense energy and luck.

Communication among the remnant is rudimentary—chalk on walls, symbols etched into pavement, occasional shortwave broadcasts. Most carry backpacks of food and signal gear, hoping to stumble into others. Travel is dangerous but necessary. Some follow roads littered with motionless crowds, others chart empty rural paths hoping for clean rivers, edible forage, and fellow humans.

The cause may never be fully understood. Some survivors speak of a divine act, a punishment, or a cosmic rebalancing. Others believe it was a test or an acceleration of natural entropy. Science offers no consensus. Instruments that might have explained it went silent as their operators fell. Theories abound. Data is sparse. Time presses on.

Those who survive carry the unbearable burden of awareness. They see the blank faces of former friends. They hear the silence of cities that once sang. They feel every moment of hunger, every sting of isolation. Some take it upon themselves to lead, to signal, to scavenge, and to write. Others find refuge in the company of animals, or in prayer, or in work—planting seeds, purifying water, watching the horizon.

Death came for the majority not with violence but with neglect. Those who lived lacked proximity to food or others with full senses. Many died surrounded by abundance they could no longer perceive. Those who live on do so because of terrain, tools, temperament, or sheer chance. Some are young and resilient. Others are old and prepared. All carry the grief of seeing the world dissolve.

Efforts now hinge on forming durable settlements, rediscovering water cycles, securing seeds, and constructing maps. Memories are fading fast. Electricity is a luxury. Books are burned for warmth or treasured as guides. Few can still build or repair. Every survivor is now a guardian of history, a link in the chain of memory, bearing witness to the Great Deprivation that reshaped humanity forever.

A uniform and total blindness without warning changes the hierarchy of human ability overnight. The collapse is sudden, complete, and irreversible for the vast majority. Without memory of sight, the blind do not even know what they’ve lost, reaching not for vision but for comfort in familiar motion, sound, and texture. In their minds, the world no longer exists in form—only in spatial habits and fading impressions. Architecture becomes meaningless, roads mere suggestion, written language a dead code no longer accessible. They exist in a loop of sensory present, where only what is touched and heard is real.

The spared survivors move in a shattered world of dim corridors and silent streets, stepping over the chaos of crowds who mill helplessly, grasping at surfaces, objects, or one another. It becomes impossible to help the many. Sheer scale and energy demands force the few to choose strategic mercy. This generation will not be saved in full, but the next may survive if a thread of continuity is pulled forward. That’s where the tension grows—between rebuilding and enduring, between the duty to salvage and the weight of survival.

Those spared often come from odd pockets of happenstance: someone underground during the event, someone in a sensory deprivation tank, or caught in a brief seizure. These anomalies suggest not a genetic immunity but a circumstantial window of exclusion from the blinding force. The event was not targeted, but omnidirectional. And yet, it did not touch those unseeing at that precise moment. The mechanism of blindness bypassed those whose neural visual pathways were momentarily disconnected.

The social collapse is as immediate as the sensory loss. Transport stops. Aircraft fall. Fires start and go unattended. Emergency services are overrun. Governments dissolve in days, unable to maintain order without communication, surveillance, or chain-of-command visibility. Food supply chains halt. Cold storage warms. Grains rot. Panic ignites and extinguishes itself in fits, as the blind struggle to organize but never coordinate.

In certain pockets, the few survivors with sight find each other. They establish sanctuaries, map new territories, and develop triage systems for energy, food, and information. Radio remains. Generators hum. Solar power becomes invaluable. Vision becomes a currency of power and risk. Small bands of sighted form clans, some focused on care, others on control. Some exploit, as expected. Others build. The ethical spectrum is wide, dictated more by personality than ideology.

Among the blind, patterns form. They group near voices, familiar smells, warmth. They build small tribal routines, following sound and vibration. Some sing to locate walls. Others tap surfaces and wait for echo. Many perish, particularly those isolated or trapped. Children wander until they fall. The old do not move. In certain places, fires burn long, unchecked. Densities shift as people move from cities to sounds of activity. Silence becomes terror, noise a magnet.

Births slow nearly to a stop. Care in darkness fails. Those born after the event grow up knowing only this new mode. They never ask about light. They don’t have a word for sky. Language itself begins to mutate. Words like blue, horizon, shadow, vanish from use. Time stretches. Memory dissolves into ritual. Those who can see begin recording, archiving, drawing for an audience that cannot see their work. It becomes a strange act of faith.

Faith returns, and in many ways grows. People believe the event was divine, or infernal, or a cosmic correction. The cause is debated but ultimately irrelevant. Survival trumps origin. Rebuilding takes generations. Order is redefined. Small cities form around rivers, hills, echoes. Leadership comes from those who adapt, not those who remember.

The number of dead reaches billions in months. Without coordination, the fragile systems of modern life collapse. Water pumps fail. Waste accumulates. Disease spreads quickly among the blind who cannot see dirt or danger. Those spared must choose between isolation and risk, between mercy and preservation. Most learn to walk away.

The future belongs to the adaptive. In time, those who can see become teachers and guides. They pass on new languages built on rhythm and proximity. Tactile maps. Sound codes. Modified Braille. Vibrational markers embedded in walkways. A new infrastructure grows quietly, without grandeur. It is less ambitious, more enduring. Vision no longer defines humanity. Resilience does.
