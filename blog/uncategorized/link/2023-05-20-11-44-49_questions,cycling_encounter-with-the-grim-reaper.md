The link in the title jumps to ***Facebook's Bicycle Travellers*** group to display a post of a world tour cyclist's personal account of recently being struck by an automobile.  The comment section is interesting as well. 

The narrator describes their ordinary day, starting with a pleasant morning and a cheerful conversation with people at a café. However, the narrative takes a dark turn when the narrator is involved in a severe accident, struck by a car while cycling. The subsequent memories are fragmented, consisting of moments in an emergency vehicle and an MRI machine. 

The narrator wakes up in a trauma center, surrounded by other patients in pain. They recount the extensive injuries they have sustained, including broken ribs, collapsed lungs, and damage to their right ear. The physical pain, particularly while breathing, is excruciating, and the reliance on painkillers brings its own challenges. The narrator also grapples with the emotional pain of indignation, feeling helpless and dependent on others for basic tasks. 

Reflecting on the encounter with the Grim Reaper, the narrator acknowledges that they will never be the same again. Their plans for cycling around the world are put on hold as they need to recover physically and mentally. The encounter has humbled the narrator, stripping away their arrogance and leaving them questioning their future path. There is uncertainty as to whether the pain and challenges they face will corrupt them, but the narrator expresses a determination to regain strength, find their drive, and rediscover their sense of purpose.
