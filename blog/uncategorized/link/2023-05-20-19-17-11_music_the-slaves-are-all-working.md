Temple of the Dog was a musical project formed in 1990 by members of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam as a tribute to the late Andrew Wood, the lead singer of Mother Love Bone.

***Hunger Strike*** is one of their most well-known songs. It features the vocals of Chris Cornell (Soundgarden) and Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) sharing lead vocal duties. The song carries a powerful and introspective message.

Artistic works often use metaphors and symbolism to provoke thought and convey deeper meanings. 

The lyrics touch upon themes of social inequality, poverty, and the struggle for justice. The hunger strike symbolizes a protest against the unfairness and suffering in the world. It conveys a life or death desire for change, unity, and empathy towards those who are marginalized or in need.

In this context, "stealing bread" suggests that the singer is willing to disrupt the status quo, even if it means taking from those who have an abundance or are living in luxury ("decadence").

Metaphorically, the line expresses a willingness to redistribute resources to address social inequalities. It serves as a critique of the imbalances of power and wealth in society and should not be taken as literal instructions or endorsements of unlawful behavior.

The lyrics employ vivid imagery to draw attention to social injustices and the exploitation of vulnerable individuals. The phrase "farming babies" metaphorically represents the exploitation of the powerless, the vulnerable, the ignorant, or those in dire circumstances. It critiques a system that perpetuates inequality and disregards human dignity.

The subsequent line, "while the slaves are all working, blood is on the table, the mouths are all choking," intensifies the portrayal of suffering and oppression. It depicts a disturbing image of people being exploited and silenced, while their basic needs and well-being are neglected.

The purpose of these lyrics is to shine a spotlight on the harsh realities of social injustice, urging listeners to recognize and address these issues. By painting a vivid picture of the hardships faced by marginalized individuals, the song encourages empathy, awareness, and a call for change.

The song's emotional intensity, combined with the raw vocal performances of Cornell and Vedder, resonates with listeners and showcases the musical talents of both bands. "Hunger Strike" remains a significant piece of music from the early 1990s grunge era, highlighting the collaboration between two influential bands and addressing meaningful social issues.

    I don't mind stealing bread from the mouths of decadence
    But I can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled
    
    But it's on the table, the fire's cooking
    And they're farming babies, while the slaves are all working
    Blood is on the table, the mouths are all choking
    But I'm goin' hungry
    
    I don't mind stealing bread from the mouths of decadence
    But I can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled
    
    But it's on the table, the fire's cooking
    And they're farming babies, while the slaves are all working
    Blood is on the table, the mouths are all choking
    But I'm goin' hungry
