A tale depicting a future world of peace, prosperity, and sharing among nations. Will nations ever stop fighting? Will there be a happy ending anytime soon? You be the judge.

Once upon a time, in a world not too far away, there were three nations: Red, Green, and Blue. They shared a magnificent land known as Earth, which was abundant with valuable resources.

One day, a traveler arrived from a distant land with a discovery: a hidden treasure called "crude oil," which lay beneath the Earth's surface. This crude oil could power their machines, light their homes, and make their lives better.

Red, being a mighty and prosperous nation, decided to extract a lot of this crude oil to fuel their progress. They thought, "We can use this oil to make our lives even better!"

Green, a proud nation with its own rich heritage, saw the potential harm this massive extraction could cause to Earth. They said, "We must be careful not to harm our precious land. We should think about the Earth's future."

Blue, representing other nations, was in the middle. They wanted to share the benefits of this valuable resource but also wanted to protect the Earth. They said, "Let's work together to use this oil wisely and protect our Earth."

As time passed, Red, driven by its desire for prosperity, extracted more and more crude oil, while Green grew worried about the Earth's health. Blue tried to mediate and find a balance between sharing the resource and caring for the Earth.

But arguments and disputes arose. Red accused Green of slowing progress, and Green accused Red of harming the Earth. Blue urged both nations to find a peaceful solution.

One day, an elder from a distant land, Wise Olive, came to offer wisdom. She shared a parable about the importance of balance and stewardship of the Earth's resources.

Wise Olive said, "In a land far away, there were nations much like yours. They fought over their resources until their land was damaged, and their people suffered. But when they learned to share and care for their Earth, they found peace and prosperity."

Red, Green, and Blue realized that they needed to find a way to use the crude oil wisely while protecting the Earth for future generations. They decided to work together, share the resource fairly, and invest in cleaner and more sustainable energy.

As they collaborated, the Earth thrived, and their nations prospered. Red, Green, and Blue learned the valuable lesson of stewardship and harmony with the Earth. They lived in peace and prosperity, always cherishing their home, Earth, and its bountiful gifts.
