(Verse 1)  
In the shadows, they conspire,  
One world rule, their dark desire,  
But we won't bow to their command,  
United we'll make our stand.  

(Pre-Chorus)  
They claim it's for peace and unity,  
But it's control they seek, not liberty,  
We won't be silenced, we won't be swayed,  
Our voices rising, we won't be afraid.  

(Chorus)  
This is our protest, a cry of defiance,  
Against the chains of their alliance,  
We'll fight for freedom, truth, and rights,  
With unity, we'll shine like lights.  

(Verse 2)  
They cloak their schemes in secrecy,  
Manipulating our democracy,  
But we see through their charade,  
Their veiled intentions won't evade.  

(Pre-Chorus)  
They claim it's for progress and growth,  
But it's our freedoms they loathe,  
We won't be silenced, we won't be swayed,  
Our voices rising, we won't be afraid.  

(Chorus)  
This is our protest, a cry of defiance,  
Against the chains of their alliance,  
We'll fight for freedom, truth, and rights,  
With unity, we'll shine like lights.  

(Bridge)  
In every city, on every street,  
We'll gather, hearts and minds will meet,  
Their authoritarian war, we'll dismantle,  
With love and courage, we'll set an example.  

(Verse 3)  
The youth rise up, our future's at stake,  
We won't let their plans overtake,  
We'll break the walls they build so high,  
And spread our wings, we'll touch the sky.  

(Pre-Chorus)  
They claim it's for the greater good,  
But it's our sovereignty they would withstood,  
We won't be silenced, we won't be swayed,  
Our voices rising, we won't be afraid.  

(Chorus)  
This is our protest, a cry of defiance,  
Against the chains of their alliance,  
We'll fight for freedom, truth, and rights,  
With unity, we'll shine like lights.  

(Outro)  
Together we stand, forever strong,  
Against the world they've built so wrong,  
In harmony, we'll make a stand,  
For a world that's free, in every land.

Lest we forget our Anti-humanists and Trans-humanists friends ...

(Verse 1)  
In a world of wires and machines,  
Lost in a sea of digital dreams,  
They say it's progress, the way to go,  
But deep inside, our hearts say no.  

(Pre-Chorus)  
We won't be just cogs in their grand design,  
We won't let them erase what makes us divine,  
Our humanity, our essence, it's worth the fight,  
We'll take a stand and shine a light.  

(Chorus)  
We won't bow down to their transhumanist decree,  
We'll reclaim our souls, be proud, and be free,  
They're building a future we don't want to see,  
With unity, we'll rise, and take back humanity.  

(Verse 2)  
They promise us a world so grand,  
But it's just control they demand,  
Trading our hearts for cold machines,  
It's time to break free from their deceptive schemes.  

(Pre-Chorus)  
We won't be just cogs in their grand design,  
We won't let them erase what makes us divine,  
Our humanity, our essence, it's worth the fight,  
We'll take a stand and shine a light.  

(Chorus)  
We won't bow down to their transhumanist decree,  
We'll reclaim our souls, be proud, and be free,  
They're building a future we don't want to see,  
With unity, we'll rise, and take back humanity.  

(Bridge)  
Their algorithms won't define our worth,  
We're more than data, we're more than just birth,  
Let's break these chains, their grip must release,  
Embracing our flaws, finding peace.  

(Guitar Solo)

(Chorus)  
We won't bow down to their transhumanist decree,  
We'll reclaim our souls, be proud, and be free,  
They're building a future we don't want to see,  
With unity, we'll rise, and take back humanity.  

(Outro)  
So stand with us, raise your voice,  
For human hearts, we make the choice,  
Together we'll resist, we'll persist,  
In the face of their agenda, we'll always exist.
