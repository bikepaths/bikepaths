Thoughts are an intrinsic part of you, manifesting as both an act and a dimension of your being. They are not separate entities to which you are subservient; rather, they belong to you, integral to your identity. Your thoughts are uniquely yours, whether they exist purely within your mind or extend beyond it. They form just one aspect of your complex existence. 

In addition to thoughts, you encompass many other facets: physical components like body parts and intangible elements like feelings, desires, will, choices, and proofs. These elements, unlike physical matter, cannot be quantified or measured mathematically. They exist as nonmaterial events that occur within your mind, shaping your experiences and interactions with the world. Feelings bring emotional depth, desires drive motivation, willpower fuels perseverance, choices reflect decision-making, and proofs represent reason and understanding. 

Together, these elements create a holistic view of your being, highlighting the intricate and multifaceted nature of human existence beyond the tangible and measurable aspects of the material world.
