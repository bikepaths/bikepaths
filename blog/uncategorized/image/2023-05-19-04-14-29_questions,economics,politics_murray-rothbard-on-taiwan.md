Murray Rothbard, a prominent libertarian thinker, examined the issue of whether the United States should defend Taiwan from an attack by mainland China. As a libertarian, Rothbard prioritized individual liberty and limited government intervention. In his analysis, he considered factors such as the principles of non-aggression and self-defense, the potential costs and consequences of military intervention, and the potential infringement on individual liberties through warfare.

In this imagined conversation, Murray Rothbard expresses the libertarian perspective, emphasizing the principles of individual liberty, limited government intervention, and the potential risks and consequences of military action. Joe Biden, on the other hand, acknowledges Rothbard's viewpoint but highlights the importance of protecting allies, preserving international order, and ensuring security in the face of potential threats.

----------

**Murray Rothbard:** Mr. President, thank you for taking the time to discuss this crucial matter. As a libertarian, I believe it's essential to carefully consider the question of whether the United States should defend Taiwan from an attack by mainland China.

**Joe Biden:** Absolutely, Murray. I'm interested to hear your perspective. We have a longstanding commitment to Taiwan's security, and I want to ensure we make the right decision.

**Murray Rothbard:** Indeed, Taiwan's security is important, but we must approach it from a principled standpoint. As libertarians, we value individual liberty and limited government intervention. When it comes to military interventions, we should be cautious about infringing on these principles.

**Joe Biden:** I understand your concern, but Taiwan's independence and the stability of the region are at stake. We have an obligation to support our allies and ensure peace in the region.

**Murray Rothbard:** I agree that stability and peace are crucial, but we should also consider the potential costs and consequences of military intervention. Such actions often lead to unintended consequences, including the loss of American lives, excessive spending, and increased government power.

**Joe Biden:** While I appreciate your perspective, we cannot ignore the potential threat posed by an aggressive China. We have a duty to protect democracies and preserve the rules-based international order.

**Murray Rothbard:** I acknowledge the concerns regarding China's behavior, but we should approach this issue through peaceful means and diplomacy. Engaging in military conflicts should be a last resort, especially when it involves the lives and liberties of our citizens.

**Joe Biden:** I understand your emphasis on diplomacy, but sometimes diplomatic efforts alone are not sufficient to deter aggression. We must show strength and unity to protect our allies and our own interests.

**Murray Rothbard:** I agree that diplomacy may have limitations, but we should carefully evaluate the potential risks and benefits of military intervention. The decision to go to war should be made with utmost caution, considering the long-term consequences and the potential erosion of individual freedoms.

**Joe Biden:** Murray, I appreciate your perspective. We will carefully consider all aspects before making any decisions. The principles of liberty and the preservation of individual freedoms are essential, and we must weigh them against the need for security and stability.

**Murray Rothbard:** Mr. President, I appreciate your consideration of the libertarian perspective. In light of that, I'm curious about the origin and veracity of our obligation to stand against aggression and support nations that share our values. Additionally, I'd like to discuss the limitations of this lofty obligation.

**Joe Biden:** Thank you for raising these important points, Murray. The origin of our obligation to stand against aggression and support like-minded nations stems from our commitment to the principles of democracy, human rights, and international cooperation. We believe in the inherent value of freedom and the responsibility to protect those who share these values.

**Murray Rothbard:** While I agree that these principles are important, we must also acknowledge the limitations of our obligations. It's crucial to consider the practicality and sustainability of such commitments, especially when they involve military actions. Additionally, we should evaluate the potential unintended consequences and the risks involved in intervening in foreign conflicts.

**Joe Biden:** I understand your concerns, Murray. Our obligations do have limitations, and we must carefully assess the feasibility and costs of military interventions. We should prioritize diplomacy, economic cooperation, and international institutions whenever possible. However, in certain cases, when there is a clear threat to our allies or global stability, we may need to consider more robust actions.

**Murray Rothbard:** I appreciate your acknowledgement of the limitations. It's important to maintain a realistic approach that balances our principles with practicality. We should also be cautious of getting entangled in conflicts that may not directly affect our national security or compromise the rights and liberties of our own citizens.

**Joe Biden:** You raise a valid point, Murray. We must always prioritize the well-being and freedoms of our own citizens. It's essential to carefully evaluate the potential risks and benefits, keeping in mind the long-term implications and the potential erosion of our own liberties in the process.

**Murray Rothbard:** Exactly, Mr. President. We should ensure that any actions we take align with our core principles and respect the rights of individuals. Logical progression raises concerns about the continual perpetuation of military interventions and commitments. This reasoning has no end, as each defense measure necessitates another in an endless cycle. Military interventions at the expense of personal liberties leads to the neglect of the real threat posed by the encroachment of the State on our rights. 

Surrendering our freedoms under the guise of preserving them is akin to the paradoxical concept depicted in George Orwell's "1984." The notion of "freedom is slavery" symbolizes the manipulation of language and ideas by authoritarian regimes and serves as a reminder to remain vigilant in protecting our liberties and not to compromise them in the pursuit of security or other noble objectives.

**Joe Biden:** Your time is up.  Where is my cue card?
