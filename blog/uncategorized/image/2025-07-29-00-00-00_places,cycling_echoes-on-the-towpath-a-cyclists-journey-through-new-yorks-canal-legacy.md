For many, the Erie Canal Trail, part of the expansive Empire State Trail, represents a familiar and accessible pathway through New York's rich history. Along the way, cyclists often journey through Rome, NY, visiting the Fort Stanwix National Monument, a site that stands as a testament to Revolutionary War resilience. This fort is a place where the ideals of a nascent nation were fiercely defended, its strategic importance evident in the landscape.

What many do not know is an obscure trailhead, a hidden passage located directly behind the fire station on Black River Blvd that leads to a nature wonderland up north [(Google Maps)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/39WKQmrR3JqGyBrK8). This unassuming gateway is barely visible when standing on the northeast corner of Fort Stanwix. From this point, the river trail winds along the Upper Mohawk River corridor, passing the "During the siege of Fort Stanwix Aug. 1777" historical marker near the now vacant Staley Junior High School. This marker provides a poignant reminder of the strategic importance of this ground, explaining how the British camp during that pivotal siege was situated precisely between the marker and a bluff to the south. To cycle past is to feel the echoes of a struggle that defined a nation.

Cross over the bridge and follow the trail as it continues along the river.  There is much to explore and eventually you will pass the B-52 Bomber Memorial at the former Griffiss Air Force Base. This B-52G Stratofortress, named "Mohawk Valley," is a silent guardian, a powerful tribute to aviation history and the region's evolving strategic importance through different eras of conflict. It is a stark reminder that the land's story is continuous, adapting to new challenges and technologies. The path continues along the river and leads to Ridge Mills in north Rome.

From Ridge Mills, the trail transitions to gravel, suitable for mountain bikes. This segment allows for a dynamic cycling experience, with opportunities to switch between road and gravel trail all along the way. This flexibility enables riders to tailor their journey to their preference, whether seeking a smoother paved surface or the challenge of off-road terrain. The trail approaches Lake Delta Park and the Delta Reservoir, a scenic area offering camping facilities and recreational opportunities. The reservoir itself was created in 1912 by a dam project that flooded the village of Delta, a poignant example of progress demanding sacrifice. Before reaching the lake, the Rome Fish Hatchery is a significant facility for fish stocking in New York, playing a crucial role in conservation and the ecological health of the state's waters, it is currently closed to visitors. Its presence speaks to the ongoing stewardship of the land and its resources, a continuation of the human relationship with this environment that began centuries ago.

The adventure continues as one connects to the Black River Canal Trail, a route that blends natural beauty with remarkable engineering history, offering a deeper dive into the "North Country." The Black River Canal was an auxiliary waterway; it was a vital artery, conceived to serve two primary purposes: to supply water to the Erie Canal at its highest point in Rome, and to unlock the vast timber and agricultural resources of northern New York, opening the region to commerce. Built between 1837 and 1855, this 35-mile feeder canal was an engineering marvel in its own right, a testament to the relentless ambition of the era. It required an astonishing 109 locks to traverse a rise and fall of 1,079 feet over its relatively short length—a world record for locks per mile. As one cycles along its path, one traces the very lines of human endeavor that reshaped the landscape. Along the way, one observes tangible remnants of these impressive structures, including the notable "Five Combines," a series of locks that stand as silent monuments to the ingenuity and sheer labor of early canal builders. These are lessons in the "how" of history, revealing the methods and challenges of a bygone era. The trail winds through the rugged Lansing Kill Gorge, a dramatic natural feature that the canal carved its way through, showcasing the powerful interplay between human design and the raw force of nature. A highlight of this section is Pixley Falls State Park, where one can pause to admire its stunning 50-foot waterfalls. These falls are a powerful reminder of the natural forces that shaped the region, offering a moment of reflection on the power of water, both in its untamed beauty and its harnessed utility. The Black River Feeder Canal Trail is a part of the broader BREIA Trail System, a network of trails that continues to serve outdoor enthusiasts, and also forms a segment of the epic North Country National Scenic Trail, linking this local history to a grander, continental narrative of exploration and connection.

As the ride continues, the trail leads towards the charming village of Boonville, a destination rich in its own historical attractions, a living testament to the canal era's prosperity. Boonville's very existence and growth are inextricably linked to the Black River Canal. The canal brought commerce, people, and a new vibrancy to the region, transforming a nascent settlement into a thriving community. Here, the Black River Canal Museum offers insights into the daily lives and economic impact of the waterway, preserving artifacts and stories that allow one to understand the "how" of this living history. One can almost hear the echoes of canal boats, the shouts of lock tenders, and the bustling activity that once defined this place. In Erwin Park, one will discover a picturesque Covered Bridge, a delightful landmark that adds to the area's charm and serves as a tangible link to the historical towpath. This bridge is a symbol of continuity, connecting past and present. The Boonville Historic District invites deeper exploration, with its unique character and array of historical buildings that stand as silent witnesses to the canal's profound influence. Each building, each street, tells a story of the prosperity and community that flourished here because of the waterway. This district is a lesson in how a single piece of infrastructure can shape the very fabric of a town, leaving an indelible mark on its architecture, its economy, and its identity.

A world of bikepacking adventures awaits, a journey that transcends the physical act of cycling to become a profound engagement with the layered history of the land. The hidden trailhead behind the fire station unlocks a network of trails that promise a blend of historical discovery, natural beauty, and thrilling rides. Whether one seeks a leisurely pedal along the Empire State Trail, tracing the path of a nation's economic ascent, or a challenging mountain bike excursion on snowmobile paths, delving into the rugged beauty shaped by both nature and human ambition, this region serves as the perfect starting point for one's next unforgettable cycling epic. To ride these trails is to become part of the ongoing story of the landscape, to feel the echoes of the past beneath one's wheels, and to forge one's own path through a living history that continues to unfold with every turn of the towpath.
