The growing trend of nations like China and Russia, among others, entering trade agreements that exclude the US dollar, coupled with the rise of platforms such as the Shanghai Gold Exchange, has profound implications for gold arbitrage activities in both foreign exchange markets and street or gray markets. As countries shift towards tangible assets, gold arbitrage—profiting from price differences in different markets—becomes increasingly relevant.

Gold arbitrage in the foreign exchange market involves exploiting discrepancies in gold prices across various global markets. With the Shanghai Gold Exchange and other non-dollar-based platforms gaining prominence, opportunities for arbitrage have expanded. For instance, if gold is priced lower on the Shanghai Gold Exchange compared to Western exchanges like COMEX, traders can buy gold in Shanghai and sell it on COMEX for a profit. This activity helps align prices globally but also increases liquidity and trading volumes in markets that might previously have been peripheral. The introduction of these new trading platforms diversifies the sources of gold pricing, potentially leading to more frequent arbitrage opportunities as prices converge over time.

The growing number of countries conducting trade in currencies other than the US dollar can influence gold prices through currency exchange rates. When a nation devalues its currency or a currency fluctuates significantly, it impacts the local gold price. Arbitrageurs might take advantage of these fluctuations by buying gold in markets where the currency is weaker and selling in stronger currency markets. This kind of trading necessitates swift movements and sophisticated risk management due to the volatile nature of foreign exchange rates.

On the street or gray market, gold arbitrage takes a different form but is equally significant. In countries with strict capital controls or limited access to official trading platforms, the gray market for gold thrives. Here, gold prices can vary considerably from official rates due to supply and demand imbalances, currency restrictions, and economic conditions. Individuals and informal traders buy gold in markets where it is undervalued, often due to official controls or black market rates, and sell it in markets where it fetches a higher price. 

If the local currency in a country is rapidly devaluing and there are restrictions on foreign currency transactions, the demand for gold as a stable asset can surge. This pushes up local gold prices, creating arbitrage opportunities for those who can access gold at lower prices in neighboring countries or through unofficial channels. The gray market is often less transparent and riskier due to potential legal implications, but it remains a significant aspect of gold trading in many parts of the world.

These activities have broader implications for the global economy. The increase in arbitrage trading can lead to more integrated and efficient global gold markets. It also highlights economic disparities and the challenges posed by restrictive financial policies. Countries might respond by tightening regulations on gold imports and exports, aiming to control capital flows and stabilize their economies, which in turn could impact global gold supply and demand dynamics.
