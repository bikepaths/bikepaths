#### A Call to a Deeper Adventure

There is a special kind of person who feels most at home where the pavement ends. This person finds joy in the rhythm of pedaling and a sense of purpose in the quiet wisdom of the wild. If these words speak to you, then we at BikeCamp Discoveries invite you to join us on a meaningful journey. We are building a team of passionate individuals to help us guide transformative outdoor experiences.

#### Our Vision: A Community of Exploration

Based in the beautiful landscapes of Rome, New York, BikeCamp Discoveries is creating a new kind of outdoor education. We blend the exhilarating freedom of bikepacking with the essential skills of outdoor living. Our vision is to build a thriving community where people can learn, grow, and connect with the natural world in a profound way. We are looking for collaborators who share this vision and who are eager to contribute their expertise to this exciting venture.

#### The Role of a Guide: Sharing the Journey

We are seeking individuals with a deep knowledge of bikepacking, outdoor survival, and a genuine passion for teaching. A guide with BikeCamp Discoveries is a mentor, a teacher, and a fellow adventurer. Your role will be to lead participants on unforgettable journeys through the landscapes of Central New York and beyond. You will share your skills in navigation, bike maintenance, and wilderness living. You will help create a supportive and empowering environment where participants can challenge themselves and discover their own strength and resilience.

#### Who We Are Looking For

We are searching for people with a rich background in multi-day bikepacking trips. You should be comfortable navigating varied terrains and prepared for the dynamic challenges of the outdoors. Proficiency in field bike repair is an important skill, as is a strong foundation in wilderness first aid. We value experience in leading groups and a commitment to the principles of Leave No Trace. Your ability to foster a positive group dynamic and to facilitate learning in an outdoor setting is very important.

#### An Invitation to Connect

If you are ready to be part of a team that is dedicated to creating powerful and lasting memories, we encourage you to reach out. This is an opportunity to turn your passion for the outdoors into a meaningful career. You will help shape the growth of a unique organization and inspire a new generation of adventurers. Let us work together to build a community that celebrates the untamed beauty of the wild and the incredible potential of the human spirit.

We look forward to hearing from you.
