I know that's asking a lot, and you know it too, but there will always continue to be self-learning, and if you're willing to learn as you go, what have you to lose?

Contact me if this makes sense. Obviously you must be some form of higher intelligence. We owe it to ourselves to get together, at least for an hour or two, if possible. Otherwise we can just chat online.
