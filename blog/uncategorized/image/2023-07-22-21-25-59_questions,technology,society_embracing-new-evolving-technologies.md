In today's society, many people have become heavily attached to their cellphones and other network technologies, relying on them for communication, entertainment, and information. 

However, the fear and reluctance to embrace AI remain prevalent among some individuals, despite their acceptance of other network technologies. 

This discrepancy can be attributed to various factors, including concerns about AI's potential impact on privacy, autonomy, and ethical considerations.

Cellphones and other network technologies, like computers and the internet, have become integral parts of modern life, offering undeniable benefits and conveniences. 

They have gradually woven themselves into the fabric of society, making it easier to adapt to their use. These technologies have been widely adopted for years, leading to a level of familiarity that diminishes fear.

On the other hand, AI is a relatively newer and rapidly evolving technology. It is often associated with sophisticated algorithms, machine learning, and decision-making capabilities, which can trigger apprehension about the potential loss of control or unpredictability of AI systems. 

The portrayal of AI in popular culture, often depicting sentient machines or out-of-control AI, may also contribute to these fears.

AI's ability to process vast amounts of data and make decisions based on patterns can raise concerns about privacy and data security. 

The fear of entrapping or relying too much on AI may be rooted in worries about AI systems gaining too much influence over human lives or exacerbating social inequalities.
