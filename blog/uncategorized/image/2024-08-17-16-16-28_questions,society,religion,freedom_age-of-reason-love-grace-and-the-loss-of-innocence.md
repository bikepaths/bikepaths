The concept of the "Age of Reason" is often understood as the developmental stage when a child begins to grasp the difference between right and wrong and starts to develop a rational understanding of the world around them. This is usually thought to occur around the age of seven, when a child becomes capable of making more deliberate and thoughtful decisions. It’s during this time that children start to understand abstract concepts like love and grace more deeply, moving beyond the instinctual love they receive and give to a more reasoned understanding of what these emotions mean.

Love is first learned through the interactions with parents or primary caregivers. From these early experiences, children begin to form their consciousness, building an understanding of affection, empathy, and care. Love, in this context, is more than just an emotion; it’s a fundamental part of a child's development. They learn what it means to be loved unconditionally and to give love in return. Grace, in this sense, can be seen as the unconditional love that is extended to them despite their imperfections or mistakes. It is the compassion and forgiveness they receive even when they might not fully understand their actions or their consequences.

Grace is a powerful and often misunderstood concept. It can be defined as the unearned and unmerited favor or love given to someone. In a religious context, grace is often associated with divine love and forgiveness that is bestowed upon individuals regardless of their worthiness. In everyday terms, grace can be seen in the kindness and patience that parents show to their children, the second chances they give, and the gentle guidance they offer.

Small children typically do not exhibit emotions like anger, pride, envy, and jealousy in the same way older children or adults do. This absence is often attributed to their innocence. At a young age, children are more focused on their immediate needs and experiences, and they haven’t yet developed the complex social awareness that can lead to such emotions. They live more in the moment and are less concerned with comparisons, status, or resentment, which are the root causes of these negative emotions.

As children grow and start to interact more with the world around them, they begin to lose this innocence. This often happens as they become more aware of differences between themselves and others, start comparing their lives to those of others, or face disappointment or rejection. The loss of innocence can happen at different times for different children, depending on their environment and experiences. For instance, a child might feel envy when they see a peer with a toy they want, or they might experience pride when praised excessively, leading to a desire to be seen as better than others.

The loss of innocence is a natural part of growing up, but it’s also a time when the lessons of love and grace become even more crucial. As children begin to navigate more complex emotions and social dynamics, the grace they receive can help them learn how to handle these new feelings in a healthy way. The love they’ve learned from their parents or caregivers provides a foundation that can guide them through the challenges of growing up.

The age of reason is a pivotal time in a child's life when they start to understand love and grace in more rational terms. Grace, defined as unearned favor or kindness, plays a crucial role in their development, teaching them about forgiveness, compassion, and love. While small children are naturally free from complex negative emotions like anger, pride, envy, and jealousy, these feelings emerge as they grow and lose some of their innocence. The grace and love they receive during this time are essential in helping them navigate these new emotions and continue to grow into compassionate, well-rounded individuals.
