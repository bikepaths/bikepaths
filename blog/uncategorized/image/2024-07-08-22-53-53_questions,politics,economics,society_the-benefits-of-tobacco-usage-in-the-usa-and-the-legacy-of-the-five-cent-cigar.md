This analysis discusses the historical and economic benefits of tobacco usage in the USA, focusing on the period when tobacco was a significant cash crop. It also investigates the context and justification behind the statement "What this country needs is a really good five-cent cigar," attributed to Thomas Riley Marshall. The article further explores the production of five-cent cigars and the key players in the tobacco industry during that era.

Tobacco usage has historically provided several benefits to the USA, particularly in the economic realm. As a major cash crop, tobacco significantly contributed to the economy through job creation, tax revenues, and international trade. The cultivation, processing, and sale of tobacco generated employment opportunities in farming, manufacturing, and retail sectors. Tax revenues from tobacco sales have funded public projects and government initiatives.

Thomas Riley Marshall, the man who uttered the famous words "What this country needs is a really good five-cent cigar," served as Vice President of the United States under Woodrow Wilson from 1913 to 1921. He made this statement during a Senate debate in 1917, intending it as a humorous remark reflecting the nation's desire for simple, affordable pleasures amid the complexities of contemporary issues. Marshall's justification was rooted in the idea that accessible luxuries like a good, inexpensive cigar could provide comfort and satisfaction to the average American during challenging times.

The production of five-cent cigars during this period was primarily handled by numerous cigar manufacturers across the country, particularly in regions where tobacco farming was prevalent, such as Kentucky, Virginia, and North Carolina. These cigars were mass-produced to meet the demand for affordable tobacco products, ensuring that a wide range of consumers could enjoy them. Key players in the cigar production industry included brands like White Owl, King Edward, and Dutch Masters, which became synonymous with quality and affordability.
