Several factors contribute to the relatively low adoption of bicycles as a means of everyday transportation in many regions. Some of these factors include:

1. Lack of Infrastructure: Insufficient or inadequate infrastructure, such as dedicated bike lanes, secure bike parking, and comprehensive networks of interconnected paths, can discourage people from using bicycles for commuting. Without proper infrastructure, cycling can be perceived as unsafe or inconvenient, especially when sharing the road with motor vehicles.

2. Safety Concerns: Safety is a significant consideration for potential bicycle commuters. The presence of heavy traffic, aggressive driving behaviors, and inadequate driver awareness of cyclists can create a perceived risk for individuals considering cycling as a mode of transportation. Concerns about accidents and personal safety can deter people from choosing bicycles over other modes of transportation.

3. Distance and Time Constraints: Commuting by bicycle may not be feasible for individuals who live far away from their workplace or have time constraints. Longer distances, lack of shower facilities at workplaces, and the need to transport belongings or carry out multiple errands during the commute can make cycling less practical for some individuals.

4. Weather Conditions: Inclement weather, such as rain, snow, or extreme heat, can pose challenges for bicycle commuting. Unfavorable weather conditions may limit the number of days suitable for cycling or require individuals to invest in specialized gear, such as rainproof clothing or winter cycling equipment.

5. Cultural and Social Factors: Cultural norms, societal attitudes, and perceptions surrounding cycling can also impact its adoption as a mode of transportation. In some regions, cycling may be associated with specific demographics or recreational activities rather than a practical means of commuting. Social acceptance and support for cycling as a legitimate form of transportation can play a role in its adoption.

The fact that only two American cities made it into the 50 most bicycle-friendly cities in the world can be attributed to several reasons.

Many cities in the United States were developed with a focus on accommodating cars rather than promoting cycling or alternative modes of transportation. This historical emphasis on car-centric infrastructure, such as wide roads and limited cycling infrastructure, can make it challenging for cities to retrofit their infrastructure to better support bicycles.

And as mentioned above, limited cycling infrastructure, safety concerns, weather conditions, as well as cultural norms, societal attitudes, and established transportation habits all play a role in the adoption of cycling as a mode of transportation.

Improving the bicycle-friendliness of cities requires a comprehensive approach. This includes investing in cycling infrastructure, implementing safety measures, promoting public awareness and education about cycling, and fostering a culture that values and supports cycling as a sustainable and efficient mode of transportation. It may take time, effort, and a collective commitment from city planners, policymakers, and communities to create more bicycle-friendly cities in the United States.
