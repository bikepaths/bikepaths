Our world has formed into a large rooted and growing land-based community where millions upon millions live and work together in large polluted and artificial cities, where we ourselves have developed into a small governing core with our own private refuge.

Our form of government is very unique and unusual, and in our travels we have not heard of such a community as ours discussed before. We wish to discuss and share our governance model with others.

In short, we have developed a system of governance where decision-making is dominated by a secretive and privileged group with specialized knowledge and esoteric beliefs. That is to say, a tiny select few with technical expertise who possessing hidden knowledge wield substantial power and influence over the direction and policies pertaining to all inhabitants.

Let us  discuss the finer details of this form of governance in a dialog between Klaus Schwab (b.1938) and Frédéric Bastiat (b. 1801).

[Setting: A meeting between Klaus Schwab, a representative of the small governing core, and Frédéric Bastiat, a renowned classical liberal economist from the past.]

Klaus Schwab: Welcome, Mr. Bastiat. I'm delighted to have the opportunity to discuss our unique form of governance with you. As you may have heard, our system is quite unconventional, and we believe it has brought about remarkable results for our community.

Frédéric Bastiat: Thank you for inviting me, Mr. Schwab. I must admit, I'm intrigued to learn more about your governance model. From what little I've gathered, it seems to have distinct elements that depart from traditional democratic principles.

Klaus Schwab: Indeed, Mr. Bastiat. Our system is designed to prioritize efficiency and effectiveness in decision-making, given the complexity and challenges of our world. We have formed a secretive and privileged group with specialized knowledge and esoteric beliefs to govern. This group consists of experts in various fields who possess hidden knowledge, which empowers them to make informed choices for the betterment of all inhabitants.

Frédéric Bastiat: It certainly sounds like a meritocratic approach, but I must express some reservations. How do you ensure that the decisions made by this privileged group align with the needs and desires of the millions living in your community? Doesn't such a concentration of power risk alienating the general population and limiting their freedom?

Klaus Schwab: You raise valid concerns, Mr. Bastiat. We acknowledge the importance of maintaining a connection between the governing core and the wider community. While decision-making power is concentrated in the hands of the privileged few, we have established channels of communication and feedback mechanisms to ensure that the concerns and aspirations of the people are heard.

Frédéric Bastiat: That's a step in the right direction, but transparency remains essential. How do you address the issue of secrecy within this governing core? In traditional democratic systems, transparency and accountability play crucial roles in maintaining public trust.

Klaus Schwab: You're right, transparency is vital. While the inner workings of the governing core may remain somewhat opaque to protect sensitive information, we do promote a level of transparency that allows the public to understand the rationale behind decisions. We also have external oversight bodies composed of trusted individuals to review the actions of the privileged group and ensure that their decisions are in the best interest of the community.

Frédéric Bastiat: I see you've considered checks and balances to some extent, but I still worry about the potential for abuse of power. History has shown that concentrating authority in the hands of a few can lead to corruption and favoritism. How do you guard against such abuses?

Klaus Schwab: Your concerns are valid, Mr. Bastiat. To prevent abuses, we emphasize strict adherence to ethical guidelines and principles among the members of the governing core. Regular and thorough evaluations are conducted, and any breach of trust or misuse of power is met with severe consequences. Additionally, we encourage a culture of integrity and responsibility to ensure the decisions made are for the collective welfare, not for personal gain.

Frédéric Bastiat: Maintaining integrity and accountability is commendable, but I must remain cautious. Concentrating power among a few can limit diversity of thought and hinder innovation. Have you considered the potential benefits of involving a broader range of perspectives in the decision-making process?

Klaus Schwab: We recognize the value of diverse perspectives, and we have implemented advisory boards and expert panels to ensure a comprehensive consideration of ideas. While the ultimate decision-making power rests with the privileged few, we actively seek input from individuals with varying backgrounds and viewpoints to enrich the decision-making process.

Frédéric Bastiat: I appreciate the effort to include diverse voices, but I still wonder if this privileged group truly represents the multitude of perspectives and needs present in your vast community. While including advisory boards and expert panels is a step towards diversity, I worry that it may not be enough to truly capture the range of ideas and needs present in such a vast and diverse population.

You see, the strength of any society lies in its ability to harness the collective wisdom and talents of all its members. By restricting decision-making power to a select few, even if they possess specialized knowledge, you risk missing out on valuable insights and innovative solutions that could come from different perspectives and backgrounds.

In the long run, this could lead to a stagnation of progress and hinder your community's ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Moreover, history has shown us that even those with the best intentions can fall prey to the limitations of their own knowledge and biases.

Klaus Schwab: I understand your point, Mr. Bastiat, and I appreciate your concern for the inclusivity and progress of our community. However, our governance model places a premium on efficiency and effectiveness, especially considering the scale and complexity of our society. We believe that a small, knowledgeable, and experienced group can make decisions more swiftly and with greater precision.

Frédéric Bastiat: Efficiency is undoubtedly important, but it must never come at the cost of sacrificing the rights and well-being of the people it governs. I would like to introduce the concept of Natural Law, which posits that there are inherent rights and principles that apply universally to all human beings. Among these are the rights to life, liberty, and property.

By entrusting power solely to a select few, you risk infringing upon the natural rights of the majority. A system that values freedom and human dignity should involve as many perspectives as possible to ensure that policies are just, fair, and equitable for everyone.

Klaus Schwab: Natural Law is an interesting perspective, Mr. Bastiat. However, we believe that by carefully selecting individuals with specialized knowledge and esoteric beliefs, we can avoid falling into the traps of tyranny or exploitation. We have seen the challenges faced by democratic systems, where decisions can be influenced by emotional appeal rather than rationality.

Frédéric Bastiat: I concede that democratic systems have their own shortcomings, but they can also provide mechanisms to safeguard against tyranny. The idea of checks and balances, for instance, can help prevent the concentration of power in any single branch or group. It's crucial to strike a balance between expertise and representation, ensuring that those who hold authority are accountable to the people they govern.

Furthermore, transparency and open dialogue between the governing core and the wider community are essential to maintain trust. The willingness to engage in public discourse and consider alternative viewpoints will foster a sense of ownership and participation among the people, strengthening the overall fabric of your society.

Klaus Schwab: Your arguments are compelling, Mr. Bastiat. I can see the value in striking a balance between expertise and representation, as well as the importance of open dialogue and transparency. Perhaps we can revisit our governance model and explore ways to implement some of these principles without compromising efficiency.

Frédéric Bastiat: I'm glad to hear that you're open to reconsidering aspects of your system. As your community continues to evolve and face new challenges, it's essential to remain adaptable and receptive to constructive criticism. Embracing a more inclusive approach to decision-making can lead to greater unity, resilience, and ultimately, a better future for all.

Klaus Schwab: You've given me much to ponder, Mr. Bastiat. I believe that our continued dialogue will be beneficial in shaping the evolution of our governance model. Thank you for engaging in this thoughtful exchange, and I look forward to further discussions.

Frédéric Bastiat: The pleasure is mine, Mr. Schwab. I believe that through rational discourse and the pursuit of Natural Law, we can pave the way for a governance model that truly reflects the aspirations and needs of your community. May your society continue to progress towards a more just and prosperous future for everyone.
