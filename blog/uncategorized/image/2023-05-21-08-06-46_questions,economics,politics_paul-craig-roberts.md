Paul Craig Roberts holds a range of views on politics and the economy. He is known for his critical perspective on various issues and challenging mainstream narratives. Here are some key aspects of his views:

1. Economics: Roberts has been critical of free trade policies and globalization, arguing that they have had negative effects on American workers and industries. He advocates for protecting domestic industries and jobs through tariffs and trade restrictions. He also criticizes the Federal Reserve's monetary policies and has expressed concerns about the impact of excessive debt and financial speculation on the economy.

2. Government and Civil Liberties: Roberts emphasizes the importance of limited government and individual freedoms. He has been a vocal critic of government overreach, particularly in areas such as surveillance, civil liberties, and the erosion of privacy rights. He often highlights the dangers of an increasingly intrusive state and the potential abuse of power.

3. Foreign Policy: Roberts has been a strong critic of US foreign policy, particularly in relation to military interventions and regime change operations. He argues that these interventions often serve the interests of powerful interest groups rather than the well-being of the American people. He is skeptical of the mainstream media's portrayal of global conflicts and calls for a more non-interventionist approach.

4. Mainstream Media: Roberts is highly critical of mainstream media, alleging bias and propaganda in their reporting. He argues that media consolidation and corporate interests have compromised objective journalism, leading to a distorted view of events and a lack of critical analysis.

Paul Craig Roberts' views align with several thinkers and figures throughout history who share similar perspectives on economics and political philosophy. While he may not align exclusively with any one individual, he shares commonalities with the following thinkers:

1. Frédéric Bastiat: Roberts' skepticism of government intervention and his advocacy for limited government align with Bastiat's classical liberal views. Both emphasize the importance of individual rights, free markets, and the potential harm of government intervention in the economy.

2. Hilaire Belloc: Belloc, a distributist, promoted the idea of widespread property ownership and the decentralization of economic power. Roberts' criticism of globalization and his support for protecting domestic industries and jobs resonate with Belloc's concerns about economic concentration and the erosion of local economies.

3. Henry Hazlitt: Hazlitt was an economist and journalist known for his book "Economics in One Lesson." Both Roberts and Hazlitt are critical of Keynesian economics and government intervention in the economy. They advocate for free markets, sound money, and the importance of individual liberty.

4. Ludwig von Mises: Roberts shares some similarities with the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, particularly in their critique of central planning, socialism, and the importance of individual liberty and free markets. Both emphasize the role of market forces and the dangers of government intervention in the economy.

5. Friedrich Hayek: Hayek's ideas on individualism, limited government, and the importance of spontaneous order resonate with some of Roberts' views. They both express concerns about the unintended consequences of government interventions and advocate for the preservation of individual freedoms.

6. Murray Rothbard: Roberts' views also show similarities with those of Murray Rothbard, a prominent figure in the libertarian movement. Both are critical of government power, emphasize individual rights and liberties, and highlight the potential dangers of military interventions and foreign policy entanglements.

7. Ron Paul: While not a historical figure in the traditional sense, Ron Paul, a former U.S. Congressman and presidential candidate, shares some views with Roberts. They both advocate for limited government, non-interventionist foreign policy, sound money, and individual liberty.

These are general alignments as Roberts shares common ground with these thinkers. He has his own unique perspectives and analysis that incorporates elements from multiple sources and thinkers. Roberts' views span a wide spectrum, and he is known for his provocative and controversial opinions.
