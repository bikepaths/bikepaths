The societal split between those who fear AI and refuse to use it, and those who embrace AI and leverage its capabilities, could have several significant ramifications for the future. These ramifications can affect various aspects of society, economy, and individual lives. 

Here are some potential scenarios:

1. Economic Disparities: Those who embrace AI and use it to enhance their productivity and decision-making may gain a competitive advantage in the job market and business world. This could lead to economic disparities, where the AI-savvy individuals and companies outperform those who choose to stay away from AI.

2. Technological Divide: The fear of AI could create a technological divide in society. Those who refuse to use AI might fall behind in terms of adopting and adapting to new technologies, which could further widen the gap between AI users and non-users.

3. Workforce Shift: As AI continues to advance, it could lead to a significant shift in the job market. Some professions might become increasingly automated, leading to job displacement for those who are reluctant to embrace AI. At the same time, new job opportunities in AI development, data analysis, and related fields may arise for those who embrace AI.

4. Education Gap: The divide in AI usage could also impact education. Schools and institutions that embrace AI and integrate it into their teaching methods may offer a more advanced and tailored learning experience. Students taught with AI-enhanced methods may have better skills for the future job market compared to those who receive traditional education.

5. Ethical Dilemmas: The use of AI can raise ethical questions related to privacy, data ownership, and bias. If a large portion of society refuses to use AI, they might also be excluded from the discussions and decisions concerning AI ethics, potentially leaving them at a disadvantage.

6. AI Policy and Regulation: The societal split could influence the development of AI policies and regulations. Governments may struggle to strike a balance between accommodating the concerns of those who fear AI and promoting the benefits that AI can bring to society.

7. Innovation and Progress: The willingness of a minority to embrace AI could foster innovation and technological progress, driving advancements in AI applications and creating new solutions to societal challenges.

8. Social Dynamics: The split in AI usage could create social divisions, with AI users and non-users having different perspectives and beliefs about the role of AI in society. This may lead to misunderstandings and tensions between the two groups.
