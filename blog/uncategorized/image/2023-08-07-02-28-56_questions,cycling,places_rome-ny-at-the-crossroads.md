#### A City Born from a Crossroads

The story of Rome, New York, is a story of connection. Long before the first roads were paved, this land was a vital crossroads for Native American tribes. Its strategic location at the Oneida Carrying Place, a key portage on the ancient water route connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, made it a natural center for trade and travel. This legacy of connection continues to shape the city’s identity today.

#### The Dawn of a New Era: The Erie Canal

The destiny of Rome became forever intertwined with the growth of the nation on July 4, 1817. On that historic day, the first shovel of earth was turned for the construction of the Erie Canal, right here in Rome. This monumental feat of engineering, completed in 1825, was a waterway that would change the course of American history. It connected the eastern seaboard with the vast interior of the continent, transforming New York into an economic powerhouse and opening up the West to settlement and trade.

#### A Hub of Movement and Commerce

The Erie Canal solidified Rome’s role as a vital hub of transportation. The city became a bustling center of commerce, a place where goods and people flowed in a constant stream. The canal was just the beginning. Soon, roads and railroads converged on Rome, creating a complex network of transportation that further fueled its growth and prosperity. This history of movement is woven into the very fabric of the city.

#### A Modern Crossroads for the Adventurous Spirit

Today, Rome continues to be a crossroads, welcoming travelers on the modern-day equivalent of the old trade routes. The Empire State Trail, a 750-mile pathway for cyclists and hikers, follows the historic corridor of the Erie Canal, passing directly through the heart of Rome. For the modern adventurer, the city is a welcome sight, a place to rest, resupply, and connect with the rich history of the region.

#### A Place to Pause and Explore

For the long-distance cyclist, Rome is more than just a point on the map. It is a destination in itself. The city offers a chance to explore the Fort Stanwix National Monument, a reconstruction of the colonial fort that once guarded this strategic location. The Erie Canal Village provides a living history experience, a glimpse into the golden age of the canal. The original towpath, now a peaceful trail, invites a quiet ride along the historic waterway.

#### The Enduring Spirit of Connection

Rome, New York, is a city with a deep and resonant history. It is a place where the stories of the past are still alive, written in the landscape and preserved in its historic sites. For the traveler on the Empire State Trail, a stop in Rome is a chance to connect with this history, to feel the enduring spirit of a place that has always been, and continues to be, a vital American crossroads.
