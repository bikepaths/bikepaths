Releasing pain, suffering, and negativity from life involves a conscious journey of self-discovery and transformation. 

It begins with acknowledging these feelings and allowing yourself to feel them without judgment. 

Embracing mindfulness helps to observe these emotions without getting entangled in them. 

Cultivating self-compassion and practicing forgiveness, both towards oneself and others, can gradually loosen the grip of negativity. 

Engaging in activities that bring joy, fostering positive relationships, and seeking guidance if necessary, contribute to the process of letting go. 

Ultimately, it's about cultivating a mindset of gratitude, focusing on the present moment, and actively choosing thoughts and actions that promote healing and growth.

Here are the steps:

1. **Acknowledge Your Own Feelings:** Recognize and accept your emotions without judgment.

2. **Show Compassion Toward Yourself:** Treat yourself kindly, as you would a friend in pain.

3. **Practice Mindfulness:** Focus on the present moment, letting go of past regrets and future worries.

4. **Positive Thinking:** Replace negative thoughts with positive statements.

5. **Gratitude:** Focus on what you have and what's going well in your life.

6. **Forgiveness:** Let go of resentment towards yourself and others.

7. **Socialize:** Reach out to good people.

8. **Become Engaged:** Do things that bring joy and a sense of accomplishment.
