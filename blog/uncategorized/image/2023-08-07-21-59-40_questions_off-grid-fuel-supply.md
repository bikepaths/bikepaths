When we talk about being prepared for emergencies, the importance of fuel, like gasoline or diesel, is undeniable. It's what powers not only our cars but also the generators we rely on. But have you ever wondered what would happen if we used up all the fuel we had stored?

The consequences would be significant, reaching beyond just the possibility of society collapsing. It would affect our ability to use engines and generators, which are crucial in emergencies. To understand this better, let's explore how long fuel lasts, the problems caused by things like oxidation, moisture, and bacteria, and why proper storage is essential to keep fuel usable.

Gasoline and diesel, which are the main sources of energy, don't last very long. After about six months, they start to break down, especially if they're stored in temperatures above 70°F. This breaking down process is called oxidation, and while we can't stop it completely, we can slow it down by adding antioxidants to the fuel.

Another challenge is moisture, which can be harmful to fuel. If water comes into contact with gasoline or diesel, they start to break down even faster. Sometimes, moisture can get inside the storage container due to changes in temperature. This wet environment becomes a breeding ground for bacteria, which is why we might need to use special chemicals, called biocides, to make the fuel last longer.

It's also important to store fuel in the right conditions. Keeping it at a lower temperature, around 20°F, and using metal or stainless containers can help preserve it. Even with all these precautions, including antioxidants, biocides, and careful storage, fuel can only last for about three years. Gasoline tends to last longer than diesel, but both have their limits.

Considering the possibility of running out of stored fuel, there are other options to explore. One potential substitute is biogas, which is created from things like organic waste, animal manure, human waste, and crops. While it sounds promising, making biogas is complex and requires a lot of different ingredients. It takes a long time to produce, which might not be practical during emergencies, and it can also be risky if you don't know how to do it properly.
