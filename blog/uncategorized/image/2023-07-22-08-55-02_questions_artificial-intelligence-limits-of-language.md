Artificial Intelligence (AI) understands and responds to various languages but may face challenges with certain parts of language during its ongoing development. 

These parts include:

1. Slang and informal language: AI may struggle to understand informal words or expressions not present in its extensive dataset, potentially leading to misinterpretation.
Example: Asking AI, "What's the tea?" referring to gossip or juicy news might not yield relevant results.

2. Accents: AI's ability to comprehend certain accents may be limited, resulting in misinterpretation or partial understanding of spoken commands.
Example: Someone with a strong Scottish accent asking AI for "weather in Edinburgh" might receive weather information for "Edinborough" instead.

3. Ambiguous questions or language: AI might have difficulty interpreting questions or phrases that could have multiple meanings, leading to responses that don't match the intended query.
Example: Asking AI, "Where is the bank?" might lead to directions to a financial institution or a river bank, depending on context.

4. Open-ended questions without a single correct answer: AI may not provide definitive responses to questions that lack a specific answer.
Example: Inquiring, "What is the best movie ever made?" might elicit different responses based on individual preferences.

5. Long and complex questions: AI might have trouble processing lengthy or intricate queries, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate responses.
Example: A detailed technical question with multiple conditions and parameters might be challenging for AI to address fully.

6. Dialects of languages: While AI understands various languages, it may not recognize certain regional dialects, causing difficulties in comprehension.
Example: Requesting AI to translate a phrase from a local dialect might lead to an inaccurate or unfamiliar response.

7. Idioms, figurative language, and puns: AI may not grasp the meaning or humor behind idioms, figurative expressions, or puns if not explicitly trained to do so.
Example: Asking AI the meaning of the idiom "break a leg" might not result in the correct interpretation of wishing someone good luck.

8. Linguistic nuances in a language: AI might not fully comprehend subtle differences in language usage, leading to imprecise or incomplete answers.
Example: Inquiring about the distinction between "good" and "well" might not yield a nuanced response that covers all contexts.
