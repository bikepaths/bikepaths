Then the deeper question: did man invent God, or did God invent man? Both views hold weight depending on who speaks. One sees belief as breath from beyond. The other sees it as a mirror held up by need. Somewhere in between, the longing for meaning reaches across time.

Tradition holds value when it roots us in something larger than ego, but it must breathe or it decays. The will to create anew rises when old forms stop bearing fruit. Yet hatred for what was eternally given, the gift of beauty, truth, humility, often emerges when those gifts go unreceived, unseen, or twisted by control. What was offered in love becomes resented when imposed without understanding.

So the tension: receive what was handed down, or make something new?

Maybe both are needed. Maybe tradition is not the cage, but the floor beneath creation.

Maybe renewal begins when the old is touched with honest hands, and not discarded.
