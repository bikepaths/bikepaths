#### The City of Angels on Two Wheels

Los Angeles is a city of endless discovery, a sprawling landscape of diverse neighborhoods and vibrant cultures. For the bicycle nomad, it offers a unique opportunity to experience this iconic city at a human pace. This guide will help you navigate the streets of LA with confidence, offering insights into the city’s bike-friendly routes, essential safety practices, and the resources available to the urban adventurer.

#### The Rules of the Road

To travel safely in Los Angeles, it is important to understand the rules of the road. Bicyclists have the same rights and responsibilities as motorists. This means riding with the flow of traffic, using bike lanes when they are available, and always yielding to pedestrians. For night riding, a white headlight and a red rear reflector are essential for visibility. A helmet is always a good idea for your safety.

#### Finding Your Path

Los Angeles has a growing network of bike paths and routes that offer a beautiful way to explore the city. The Marvin Braude Bike Trail, also known as “The Strand,” is a 22-mile coastal path that takes you along some of Southern California’s most iconic beaches. The Los Angeles River and Ballona Creek bikeways offer car-free corridors through the heart of the city. Griffith Park, a vast urban wilderness, has numerous trails for all skill levels, offering stunning views of the city and the famous observatory.

#### A Community of Support

Los Angeles has a vibrant cycling community and a network of resources to support the bicycle nomad. Bike shops and cooperatives can be found throughout the city, offering repairs, supplies, and a friendly place to connect with other riders. The Los Angeles County Bicycle Coalition is a great resource for maps, safety information, and a list of bike-friendly businesses.

#### A Place to Rest

Finding a place to rest for the night in a city as large as Los Angeles can be a challenge, but there are options available. Several state parks and campgrounds in the surrounding area offer hike-in/bike-in sites. For a more urban experience, hospitality networks like Warmshowers connect traveling cyclists with local hosts who offer a place to stay. These connections can be a wonderful way to experience the city through the eyes of a local.

#### The Spirit of Urban Exploration

Navigating Los Angeles by bicycle is an adventure in itself. It is a chance to discover the city’s hidden gems, to connect with its diverse communities, and to experience its unique energy from a new perspective. With a spirit of adventure and a little preparation, you can create an unforgettable journey through the City of Angels.
