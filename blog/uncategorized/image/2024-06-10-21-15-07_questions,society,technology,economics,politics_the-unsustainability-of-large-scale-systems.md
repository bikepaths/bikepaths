The idea that everything organized at a gigantic scale is heading toward failure reflects a critical view of modern society's reliance on massive institutions and systems. 

This perspective suggests that big governments, giant companies, huge capital investment firms, global shipping, energy production, chain retailing, mass motoring, big electricity, big medicine, and big education are all on a path to collapse. 

The primary concern is that these large entities are unsustainable and too complex to manage effectively. Their sheer size makes them inflexible and unable to adapt quickly to changing circumstances, which is a significant disadvantage in a rapidly evolving world.

Critics argue that as these institutions grow, they become increasingly bureaucratic and disconnected from the needs of individuals. This leads to inefficiencies, waste, and a lack of innovation. Big governments may struggle to address local issues effectively because their policies are designed to cater to a wide range of needs and situations. Similarly, large corporations may prioritize profits over social responsibility, leading to unethical practices and exploitation.

The centralization of power and resources in these giant systems can create vulnerabilities. When a large entity fails, the impact can be widespread and devastating, affecting millions of people and multiple sectors of the economy. This can be seen in the financial crises caused by the collapse of major banks or the widespread disruptions caused by failures in the global supply chain.

Politicians and economists often advocate for the consolidation of these systems into even larger, more centralized structures, believing that advanced technology can manage these complexities. They propose that computer technology and automation can create efficient, seamless operations on a mega-scale. However, this view is often criticized for being overly optimistic and for underestimating the potential for technological failures and cybersecurity threats.
