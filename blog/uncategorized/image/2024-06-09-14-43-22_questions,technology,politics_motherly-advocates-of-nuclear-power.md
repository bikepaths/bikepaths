Mothers for Nuclear, founded by Heather Hoff and Kristin Zaitz, is an organization dedicated to promoting nuclear power as a crucial environmental technology. By focusing on the influential role of mothers, they aim to dispel fears and misinformation surrounding nuclear energy, advocating for policies that support the continued operation and development of nuclear plants. Their mission is to ensure a cleaner, safer future for their children by replacing fossil fuels with reliable, clean energy sources like nuclear power, while fostering an open dialogue and education on the topic.

- Mothers for Nuclear is an environmental organization founded by Heather Hoff and Kristin Zaitz.

- The organization encourages pro-nuclear mothers to speak out and engage in international dialogue about nuclear power and environmental protection.

- The focus on mothers is because they have a strong commitment to protecting their children's health, the environment, and the climate.

- The organization asks supporters of nuclear power to share their stories and invites open-minded but hesitant individuals to ask questions.

- They emphasize that their motivation is not job security, but the desire to leave behind a better world for their children.

- Their goal is to change public perception of nuclear power as a vital environmental technology, leading to policy changes and the continued operation and construction of nuclear plants.

- They believe nuclear plants are closing due to unfair policies influenced by popular fears and the rapid growth of wind and solar energy supported by federal subsidies and state mandates.

- They argue that nuclear power is the safest way to generate grid electricity, supported by independent public health experts.

- The worst nuclear accidents, Chernobyl and Fukushima, had little to no health impact on the public, with greater damage caused by panic and fear-mongering.

- They assert that solar and wind power cannot currently provide reliable, 100% consistent power without fossil fuel backup, and batteries and storage technology are not yet sufficient.

- They believe people can overcome their fears of nuclear power through education, discussion, and understanding the facts.

- Mothers for Nuclear is not an industry front group; it was started independently by two mothers trying to save Diablo Canyon, California's last nuclear plant.

- Donations are intended to cover expenses related to editing, posting new stories, responding to questions, and travel.

- The organization invites further questions on their Dialogue page and provides ongoing information.

- Membership is not limited to mothers; it includes anyone who supports clean energy for a better future.
