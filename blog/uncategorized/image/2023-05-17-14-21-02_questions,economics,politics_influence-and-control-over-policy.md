Since President Eisenhower's warning about the military-industrial complex in 1961, there have been several instances where its influence and control over policies have been observed. 

Here are ten specific examples:

1. Vietnam War: The military-industrial complex played a significant role in escalating the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Defense contractors lobbied for increased military spending and influenced policymakers to continue the war effort, prolonging the conflict and causing immense human suffering.

2. Iraq War: The invasion of Iraq in 2003 was influenced by the military-industrial complex. Companies involved in the defense industry stood to benefit from the war, leading to questions about the true motivations behind the decision to engage in military action.

3. Weapons procurement: The military-industrial complex has exerted influence over weapons procurement decisions, often leading to excessive spending on unnecessary or ineffective weaponry. This has been observed in various defense contracts throughout the years.

4. Lobbying and campaign contributions: Defense contractors and industry lobbyists have made significant campaign contributions to politicians, leading to their influence over policy decisions related to defense spending, military operations, and national security.

5. Influence on intelligence agencies: The military-industrial complex has had an impact on intelligence agencies, shaping their priorities and sometimes leading to biased or flawed intelligence assessments that support military interventions or the sale of arms.

6. Influence on congressional committees: Members of congressional committees responsible for overseeing defense and military affairs often receive support from defense contractors, which can create conflicts of interest and impact their decision-making.

7. Revolving door phenomenon: There is a revolving door between the defense industry and government positions. Former military and defense officials often join defense companies or lobbying firms, blurring the lines between public service and private interests.

8. Budget allocation: The military-industrial complex has influenced the allocation of federal budgets, directing significant resources towards military spending at the expense of other crucial sectors such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.

9. Surveillance and intelligence technologies: Companies within the military-industrial complex have played a role in developing and promoting surveillance and intelligence technologies, raising concerns about privacy and civil liberties.

10. Influence on foreign policy: The military-industrial complex has had a considerable influence on shaping U.S. foreign policy, particularly regarding arms sales and military alliances. This influence can sometimes lead to policies that prioritize military solutions over diplomatic efforts.
