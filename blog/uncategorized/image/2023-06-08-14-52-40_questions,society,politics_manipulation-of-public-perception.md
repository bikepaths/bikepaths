The issue of disinformation and the manipulation of public perception is complex. 

Foreign actors, as well as domestic officials, can engage in tactics to sow doubt and erode trust in reliable sources of information. 

These tactics can involve spreading false or misleading narratives, shifting narratives over time, or promoting conspiracy theories.

When it comes to evaluating information and forming our own judgments, it is essential to maintain a critical mindset and employ media literacy skills. 

Here are some points to consider:

1. Verify information from multiple sources: Relying on a variety of reputable sources can help you gain a more comprehensive understanding of an issue. Cross-referencing information can reduce the influence of biased or misleading narratives.

2. Fact-check claims: Independent fact-checking organizations can help assess the accuracy of statements made by officials or media outlets. Fact-checkers provide evidence-based analysis and can help separate factual information from misinformation or disinformation.

3. Assess credibility and expertise: Evaluate the credibility and expertise of the sources providing information. Consider the track record, reputation, and potential biases of individuals or organizations involved. Recognize that reliable sources adhere to journalistic standards, provide evidence, and are transparent about their methods.

4. Stay informed and engaged: Being actively engaged in current events and staying informed can help you recognize shifts in narratives or inconsistencies over time. Keeping a record of significant events and the evolving information surrounding them can provide valuable context for evaluating future statements.

5. Maintain a healthy skepticism: It's important to be cautious and critical of information, especially when it comes to contentious issues or those with political implications. Recognize that new evidence, investigations, or changing circumstances can lead to updated information, but also be wary of deliberate attempts to manipulate or deceive.

While it can be challenging to navigate through shifting narratives and changing information, by employing critical thinking skills, being informed, and verifying information from reliable sources, you can make more informed judgments and reduce the influence of disinformation or misleading tactics.
