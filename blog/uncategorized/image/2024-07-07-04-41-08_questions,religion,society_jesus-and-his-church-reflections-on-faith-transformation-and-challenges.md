The King James Version (KJV) of the Bible, Jesus' intent regarding the establishment of the church is illustrated through his words at the Last Supper and his declaration to Peter.

Institution of the Eucharist:

During the Last Supper, Jesus said to his disciples:

"And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you." (Luke 22:19-20 KJV)

In these verses, Jesus establishes the Eucharist as a means for his followers to remember his sacrifice and to maintain a spiritual connection with him. The bread and wine symbolize his body and blood, and the act of sharing them becomes a central ritual for the Christian community.

Peter as the Rock:

Jesus' words to Peter are found in the Gospel of Matthew:

"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." (Matthew 16:18 KJV)

In this verse, Jesus designates Peter as the foundational leader of his church. The name "Peter" (derived from the Greek word "Petros," meaning "rock") signifies strength and stability. By calling Peter the rock upon which the church will be built, Jesus entrusts him with a key role in establishing and guiding the early Christian community.

Together, these scriptures demonstrate Jesus' intent to create a lasting spiritual community. The Eucharist serves as a unifying practice for remembering Jesus' sacrifice, while Peter's leadership provides the structural foundation for the church. This combination of ritual and leadership underscores Jesus’ vision for a cohesive, enduring church that embodies his teachings of love, sacrifice, and community.

This combination of ritual and leadership underscores Jesus’ vision for a cohesive, enduring church that embodies his teachings of love, sacrifice, and community.

Today, the church that embodies Jesus' vision of love, sacrifice, and community is a global and diverse institution, unified by core beliefs and practices rooted in his teachings.

- Rituals and Sacraments:

The Eucharist, or Holy Communion, remains a central ritual in many Christian denominations. Celebrated regularly during worship services, it commemorates Jesus’ Last Supper and his sacrificial love. Other sacraments, such as baptism, confirmation, marriage, and anointing of the sick, also play vital roles in the spiritual lives of believers, marking significant moments of faith and connection to the divine.

- Leadership:

The church continues to be guided by a structured leadership. In the Catholic Church, the Pope, bishops, priests, and deacons maintain the hierarchical leadership that traces its roots back to Peter. Other Christian denominations have their own forms of governance, such as councils, synods, and assemblies, ensuring that the teachings of Jesus are upheld and the community is nurtured.

- Community and Fellowship:

Local congregations serve as the heart of the church, providing a sense of belonging and support. These communities gather for worship, prayer, and fellowship, fostering relationships built on mutual love and respect. Churches often engage in various outreach programs, charitable works, and social justice initiatives, reflecting Jesus' call to care for the marginalized and needy.

- Teaching and Preaching:

The teachings of Jesus are disseminated through sermons, Bible studies, and religious education programs. Clergy and lay leaders alike work to interpret and apply the scriptures in ways that are relevant to contemporary life, guiding believers in their spiritual journeys.

- Global Presence:

The church exists on every continent, encompassing a wide array of cultures, languages, and traditions. Despite this diversity, there is a shared commitment to the core message of Jesus: love God and love your neighbor as yourself. This universality embodies the cohesive and enduring nature of the church that Jesus envisioned.

- Adaptation and Continuity:

The church has evolved over the centuries, adapting to cultural and societal changes while striving to remain true to its foundational teachings. Modern challenges, such as technological advancements and shifting social norms, are met with efforts to reinterpret ancient truths in ways that resonate with contemporary believers.

In essence, the church today strives to be a living expression of Jesus’ teachings, maintaining the balance between ritual and leadership, fostering a global community rooted in love and service, and continually adapting to meet the needs of its followers.

His approach would be inclusive, adaptable, and focused on bringing people together to create a more just, peaceful, and loving world.

If Jesus were to address sin and its problems in the modern world, his approach would likely be rooted in his core teachings of love, forgiveness, and redemption. Here’s how he might address these issues today:

- Emphasizing Love and Compassion:

Jesus would teach that the root of overcoming sin lies in love and compassion. He would encourage people to love their neighbors as themselves (Matthew 22:39) and to treat others with kindness and empathy. By fostering a culture of love and understanding, individuals would be less likely to commit acts that harm themselves or others.

- Offering Forgiveness and Redemption:

Just as Jesus forgave those who sinned against him, he would continue to offer forgiveness to those who repent and seek to change their ways (Luke 23:34, John 8:11). He would emphasize that no one is beyond redemption and that everyone has the opportunity to start anew through sincere repentance and commitment to living a better life.

- Addressing the Root Causes of Sin:

Jesus would focus on addressing the underlying issues that lead to sin, such as poverty, injustice, and lack of education. By advocating for social justice, economic equality, and compassionate governance, he would work to create an environment where people are less likely to be driven to sin by desperation or ignorance.

Jesus would teach the importance of personal responsibility in overcoming sin. He would encourage individuals to reflect on their actions, acknowledge their wrongdoings, and strive to improve themselves. Through parables and teachings, he would illustrate the value of personal growth and the transformative power of sincere effort to live a righteous life (Luke 15:11-32, the Parable of the Prodigal Son).

- Building Supportive Communities:

His focus would be on love, forgiveness, and the transformative power of redemption, helping individuals and communities overcome sin and build a more just and loving world.

If Jesus were addressing the concepts of Satan and condemnation in the modern world, he would likely emphasize his core messages of love, forgiveness, and redemption, while also acknowledging the reality of evil and its consequences. Here’s how he might approach these topics:

- Recognizing the Reality of Evil:

Jesus acknowledged the existence of Satan and evil forces in the world. He would continue to teach about the reality of these forces and their impact on human lives. However, his focus would be on empowering individuals to resist evil through faith, love, and righteous living (Matthew 4:1-11).

- Emphasizing Personal Responsibility and Vigilance:

Jesus would encourage people to be vigilant and mindful of their actions and choices. He would teach that everyone has the responsibility to resist temptation and to strive for goodness. By fostering a strong moral foundation and spiritual discipline, individuals can stand against the influence of evil (1 Peter 5:8-9).

- Offering Forgiveness and Redemption:

Jesus' message would emphasize that no one is beyond redemption. He would teach that while evil exists, God’s love and forgiveness are always available to those who repent and seek to change their ways. He would reassure individuals that they can overcome their past transgressions through sincere repentance and faith (Luke 15:11-32).

- Condemnation and Judgment:

While Jesus spoke of judgment and condemnation for those who persist in evil, he would also stress that his mission is to save, not to condemn. He would highlight passages like John 3:17: "For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved." Jesus would call on individuals to turn away from sin and embrace a path of righteousness, emphasizing God’s desire for everyone to be saved (John 3:16-17).

- Encouraging Love and Compassion:

Jesus would teach that love and compassion are powerful tools in overcoming evil. By loving and helping one another, individuals can weaken the influence of Satan and build a more just and compassionate society.

- The Role of Community:

Jesus would emphasize the importance of a supportive and loving community in resisting evil and fostering spiritual growth. He would encourage believers to come together, support one another, and hold each other accountable in their spiritual journeys. A strong community can provide the strength and encouragement needed to resist the temptations of evil (Hebrews 10:24-25).

- Spiritual Warfare:

Jesus would teach about the spiritual nature of the battle against evil. He would encourage individuals to equip themselves with spiritual tools such as prayer, fasting, and the study of scripture. By strengthening their faith and spiritual resilience, believers can stand firm against the forces of darkness (Ephesians 6:10-18).

- Hope and Assurance:

Finally, Jesus would offer hope and assurance that good ultimately triumphs over evil. He would remind individuals of his victory over death and Satan through his resurrection, providing hope and confidence that they too can overcome the power of evil through faith in him (John 16:33).

In addressing Satan and condemnation, Jesus would balance the recognition of evil’s reality with a message of hope, redemption, and the transformative power of God’s love. His teachings would inspire individuals to resist evil, seek forgiveness, and live lives of compassion and righteousness.

If the resurrected Jesus were to assess the state of his church today, his perspective would likely include both approval and disapproval, reflecting a deep love for his followers and a desire for the church to live up to its fullest potential. Here’s a possible analysis:

Approval:

- Global Reach:

Jesus would likely be pleased with the global spread of his message. Christianity has reached nearly every corner of the world, bringing the teachings of love, compassion, and salvation to billions of people.

- Charitable Work:

The church’s extensive involvement in charitable activities would likely receive Jesus' approval. Many Christian organizations provide food, shelter, medical care, and education to the needy, reflecting Jesus’ command to care for the "least of these" (Matthew 25:40).

- Community Building:

The creation of supportive communities where believers can gather, worship, and support each other would be a positive aspect. These communities offer fellowship and spiritual growth, helping individuals to live out their faith in daily life.

- Moral and Ethical Guidance:

The church’s role in promoting moral and ethical behavior would align with Jesus' teachings. Many churches advocate for social justice, peace, and ethical conduct, encouraging their members to live lives of integrity and compassion.

Disapproval:

- Division and Fragmentation:

Jesus would likely be disheartened by the numerous divisions and denominational splits within Christianity. The disunity among different Christian groups contradicts his prayer for believers to be one (John 17:21).

- Hypocrisy and Scandals:

Instances of hypocrisy, abuse, and scandals within the church would be a significant source of disapproval. These actions harm individuals and communities and tarnish the church’s witness to the world, betraying the trust placed in religious leaders.

- Materialism and Prosperity Gospel:

Jesus might disapprove of the emphasis on wealth and prosperity in some segments of the church. The prosperity gospel, which equates faith with financial success, can distort the true message of the gospel, which often focuses on humility, sacrifice, and serving others (Matthew 6:19-21).

- Neglect of Core Teachings:

There could be concern over the neglect of core teachings such as love, forgiveness, and compassion. In some cases, the church may focus more on doctrinal purity, political power, or institutional survival than on living out the fundamental principles of Jesus' message.

- Lack of Inclusivity:

Jesus would likely disapprove of any form of exclusion or discrimination within the church. His ministry was inclusive, reaching out to the marginalized and rejected, and he would expect his church to do the same (Luke 19:10).

Encouragement for the Future:

- Renewal and Reform:

Jesus would likely call for a renewal and reform within the church. He would encourage believers to return to the simplicity and purity of his teachings, focusing on love, service, and humility.

- Unity and Reconciliation:

Promoting unity and reconciliation among different Christian groups would be a priority. Jesus would encourage efforts to bridge divides, heal relationships, and work together for the common good.

- Faith in Action:

Jesus would urge the church to put faith into action through social justice initiatives, environmental stewardship, and active compassion. He would emphasize that true faith is demonstrated through loving actions (James 2:17).

- Spiritual Depth:

Encouraging deeper spiritual practices such as prayer, meditation, and study of the scriptures would be important. Jesus would call believers to cultivate a close, personal relationship with God.

- Focus on the Marginalized:

Finally, Jesus would remind the church to focus on the marginalized and oppressed, advocating for their rights and providing for their needs. This focus reflects his own ministry and the heart of his message (Matthew 25:35-36).

In summary, while Jesus would find much to commend in the church's global reach and charitable efforts, he would also call for significant reforms to address divisions, hypocrisy, materialism, and exclusion. His message would be one of hope, urging believers to return to the core principles of his teachings and to live out their faith with integrity and compassion.
