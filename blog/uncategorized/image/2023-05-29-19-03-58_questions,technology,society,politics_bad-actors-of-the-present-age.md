In the present age, bad actors who abuse technology can be categorized into various groups. 

Here are a few examples:

1. Cybercriminals: These are individuals or groups who engage in illegal activities using technology. They may conduct hacking, phishing, or malware attacks to steal sensitive information, financial data, or intellectual property. They often target individuals, organizations, or even governments for personal gain or to disrupt systems.

2. State-Sponsored Hackers: Some nations employ skilled hackers to carry out cyber espionage, sabotage, or influence operations. These bad actors target critical infrastructure, government agencies, or private organizations to steal classified information, manipulate public opinion, or disrupt systems.

3. Online Scammers: This group includes individuals who deceive and defraud people using various online platforms. They may run phishing scams, pyramid schemes, or fraudulent investment schemes, preying on unsuspecting individuals to extract money or personal information.

4. Cyberbullies: These individuals use technology, particularly social media platforms, to harass, intimidate, or humiliate others. Cyberbullies may target individuals based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics. Their actions can have severe emotional and psychological consequences on their victims.

5. Extremist Propagandists: Bad actors from extremist groups use the internet and social media platforms to spread hate speech, radical ideologies, and recruit new members. They exploit technology to amplify their message, incite violence, and promote intolerance.

6. Privacy Invaders: Some individuals or organizations collect and exploit personal data without consent, violating privacy rights. They may engage in activities such as unauthorized data tracking, data mining, or selling personal information to third parties for targeted advertising or other purposes.

7. Trusted Mainstream Media outlets working with governments  

While not all mainstream media outlets engage in unethical practices, there have been instances where media organizations, either independently or in collaboration with government entities, have been criticized for biased reporting, misinformation, or manipulation of information. 

This can indeed be considered a form of bad actor behavior when it comes to abusing the power and reach of media technology.

Instances where media outlets intentionally disseminate false information, selectively present facts to suit a particular narrative, or engage in sensationalism for higher viewership or readership can have significant consequences. 

It can erode public trust, distort public discourse, and contribute to the spread of misinformation or propaganda.

It's worth noting that not all media outlets engage in such practices, and many adhere to journalistic ethics, striving for accuracy, fairness, and transparency in their reporting. 

The presence of biased or manipulative reporting in some mainstream media outlets highlights the importance of critical media literacy and diverse sources of information. 

It is essential for individuals to verify facts, consider multiple perspectives, and engage in thoughtful analysis when consuming news and media content.

We must foster critical thinking and media literacy skills among students. 

Educating individuals about media biases, fact-checking techniques, and encouraging a healthy skepticism towards information sources can help mitigate the influence of potentially biased or manipulative media practices.

Please note that these examples represent a range of bad actors, and the motivations and techniques employed can vary significantly.
